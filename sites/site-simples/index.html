ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND</p> <p></p> <p> Lewis Carroll</p> <p></p> <p> THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER I</p> <p></p> <p> Down the Rabbit-Hole</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister</p> <p>on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had</p> <p>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no</p> <p>pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'</p> <p>thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'</p> <p></p> <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,</p> <p>for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether</p> <p>the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble</p> <p>of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White</p> <p>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p> <p></p> <p> There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice</p> <p>think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to</p> <p>itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought</p> <p>it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have</p> <p>wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);</p> <p>but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-</p> <p>POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to</p> <p>her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never</p> <p>before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to</p> <p>take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the</p> <p>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop</p> <p>down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p> <p></p> <p> In another moment down went Alice after it, never once</p> <p>considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,</p> <p>and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a</p> <p>moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself</p> <p>falling down a very deep well.</p> <p></p> <p> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she</p> <p>had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to</p> <p>wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look</p> <p>down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to</p> <p>see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and</p> <p>noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;</p> <p>here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She</p> <p>took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was</p> <p>labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it</p> <p>was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing</p> <p>somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she</p> <p>fell past it.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I</p> <p>shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll</p> <p>all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,</p> <p>even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely</p> <p>true.)</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! `I</p> <p>wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.</p> <p>`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let</p> <p>me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,</p> <p>you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her</p> <p>lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good</p> <p>opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to</p> <p>listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,</p> <p>that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude</p> <p>or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,</p> <p>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to</p> <p>say.)</p> <p></p> <p> Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right</p> <p>THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the</p> <p>people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I</p> <p>think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this</p> <p>time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall</p> <p>have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.</p> <p>Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried</p> <p>to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling</p> <p>through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what</p> <p>an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll</p> <p>never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon</p> <p>began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I</p> <p>should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember</p> <p>her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were</p> <p>down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but</p> <p>you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.</p> <p>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get</p> <p>rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of</p> <p>way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do</p> <p>bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either</p> <p>question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt</p> <p>that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she</p> <p>was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very</p> <p>earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a</p> <p>bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of</p> <p>sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a</p> <p>moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her</p> <p>was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in</p> <p>sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:</p> <p>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it</p> <p>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late</p> <p>it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the</p> <p>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found</p> <p>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps</p> <p>hanging from the roof.</p> <p></p> <p> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;</p> <p>and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the</p> <p>other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,</p> <p>wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of</p> <p>solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,</p> <p>and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the</p> <p>doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or</p> <p>the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of</p> <p>them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low</p> <p>curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little</p> <p>door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key</p> <p>in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p> <p></p> <p> Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small</p> <p>passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and</p> <p>looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</p> <p>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about</p> <p>among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but</p> <p>she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if</p> <p>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of</p> <p>very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish</p> <p>I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only</p> <p>know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things</p> <p>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few</p> <p>things indeed were really impossible.</p> <p></p> <p> There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she</p> <p>went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on</p> <p>it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like</p> <p>telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which</p> <p>certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck</p> <p>of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'</p> <p>beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p> <p></p> <p> It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little</p> <p>Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look</p> <p>first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';</p> <p>for she had read several nice little histories about children who</p> <p>had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant</p> <p>things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules</p> <p>their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker</p> <p>will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your</p> <p>finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had</p> <p>never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked</p> <p>`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or</p> <p>later.</p> <p></p> <p> However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured</p> <p>to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort</p> <p>of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast</p> <p>turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished</p> <p>it off.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up</p> <p>like a telescope.'</p> <p></p> <p> And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and</p> <p>her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right</p> <p>size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.</p> <p>First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was</p> <p>going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about</p> <p>this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my</p> <p>going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be</p> <p>like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is</p> <p>like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember</p> <p>ever having seen such a thing.</p> <p></p> <p> After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided</p> <p>on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!</p> <p>when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the</p> <p>little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,</p> <p>she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it</p> <p>quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb</p> <p>up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;</p> <p>and when she had tired herself out with trying,</p> <p>the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to</p> <p>herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'</p> <p>She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very</p> <p>seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so</p> <p>severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered</p> <p>trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game</p> <p>of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious</p> <p>child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no</p> <p>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why,</p> <p>there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable</p> <p>person!'</p> <p></p> <p> Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under</p> <p>the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on</p> <p>which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.</p> <p>`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,</p> <p>I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep</p> <p>under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I</p> <p>don't care which happens!'</p> <p></p> <p> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which</p> <p>way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to</p> <p>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to</p> <p>find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally</p> <p>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the</p> <p>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,</p> <p>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the</p> <p>common way.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER II</p> <p></p> <p> The Pool of Tears</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much</p> <p>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good</p> <p>English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that</p> <p>ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her</p> <p>feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so</p> <p>far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on</p> <p>your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't</p> <p>be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself</p> <p>about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be</p> <p>kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the</p> <p>way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of</p> <p>boots every Christmas.'</p> <p></p> <p> And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.</p> <p>`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll</p> <p>seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the</p> <p>directions will look!</p> <p></p> <p> ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</p> <p> HEARTHRUG,</p> <p> NEAR THE FENDER,</p> <p> (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).</p> <p></p> <p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in</p> <p>fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took</p> <p>up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p> <p></p> <p> Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one</p> <p>side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get</p> <p>through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to</p> <p>cry again.</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great</p> <p>girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in</p> <p>this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all</p> <p>the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool</p> <p>all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the</p> <p>hall.</p> <p></p> <p> After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the</p> <p>distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p> <p>It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a</p> <p>pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the</p> <p>other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to</p> <p>himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she</p> <p>be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate</p> <p>that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit</p> <p>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,</p> <p>sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid</p> <p>gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard</p> <p>as he could go.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very</p> <p>hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:</p> <p>`Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday</p> <p>things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in</p> <p>the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this</p> <p>morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little</p> <p>different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in</p> <p>the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began</p> <p>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age</p> <p>as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of</p> <p>them.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such</p> <p>long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm</p> <p>sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,</p> <p>oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,</p> <p>and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the</p> <p>things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,</p> <p>and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!</p> <p>I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the</p> <p>Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.</p> <p>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,</p> <p>and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been</p> <p>changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'</p> <p>and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,</p> <p>and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and</p> <p>strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--</p> <p></p> <p> `How doth the little crocodile</p> <p> Improve his shining tail,</p> <p> And pour the waters of the Nile</p> <p> On every golden scale!</p> <p></p> <p> `How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p> <p> How neatly spread his claws,</p> <p> And welcome little fishes in</p> <p> With gently smiling jaws!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and</p> <p>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel</p> <p>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little</p> <p>house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so</p> <p>many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm</p> <p>Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their</p> <p>heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look</p> <p>up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I</p> <p>like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down</p> <p>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a</p> <p>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads</p> <p>down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was</p> <p>surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little</p> <p>white kid gloves while she was talking. `How CAN I have done</p> <p>that?' she thought. `I must be growing small again.' She got up</p> <p>and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,</p> <p>as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,</p> <p>and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the</p> <p>cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it</p> <p>hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p> <p></p> <p>`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at</p> <p>the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in</p> <p>existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed</p> <p>back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut</p> <p>again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as</p> <p>before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,</p> <p>`for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare</p> <p>it's too bad, that it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another</p> <p>moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first</p> <p>idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that</p> <p>case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had</p> <p>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general</p> <p>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find</p> <p>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in</p> <p>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and</p> <p>behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that</p> <p>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine</p> <p>feet high.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,</p> <p>trying to find her way out. `I shall be punished for it now, I</p> <p>suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer</p> <p>thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a</p> <p>little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at</p> <p>first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then</p> <p>she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that</p> <p>it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this</p> <p>mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should</p> <p>think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in</p> <p>trying.' So she began: `O Mouse, do you know the way out of</p> <p>this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'</p> <p>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:</p> <p>she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having</p> <p>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a</p> <p>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather</p> <p>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little</p> <p>eyes, but it said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I</p> <p>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the</p> <p>Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had</p> <p>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she</p> <p>began again: `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in</p> <p>her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the</p> <p>water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg</p> <p>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the</p> <p>poor animal's feelings. `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate</p> <p>voice. `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: `don't be</p> <p>angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:</p> <p>I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</p> <p>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,</p> <p>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so</p> <p>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and</p> <p>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital</p> <p>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,</p> <p>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt</p> <p>certain it must be really offended. `We won't talk about her any</p> <p>more if you'd rather not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end</p> <p>of his tail. `As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family</p> <p>always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear</p> <p>the name again!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the</p> <p>subject of conversation. `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'</p> <p>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: `There is</p> <p>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</p> <p>A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly</p> <p>brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and</p> <p>it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I</p> <p>can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you</p> <p>know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!</p> <p>He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the</p> <p>Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and</p> <p>making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p> <p></p> <p> So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear! Do come back</p> <p>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't</p> <p>like them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam</p> <p>slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice</p> <p>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to</p> <p>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll</p> <p>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded</p> <p>with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a</p> <p>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious</p> <p>creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the</p> <p>shore.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER III</p> <p></p> <p> A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the</p> <p>bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their</p> <p>fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and</p> <p>uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they</p> <p>had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed</p> <p>quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with</p> <p>them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had</p> <p>quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,</p> <p>and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';</p> <p>and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,</p> <p>and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no</p> <p>more to be said.</p> <p></p> <p> At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among</p> <p>them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL</p> <p>soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large</p> <p>ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes</p> <p>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad</p> <p>cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?</p> <p>This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!</p> <p>"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was</p> <p>soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been</p> <p>of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very</p> <p>politely: `Did you speak?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought you did,' said the Mouse. `--I proceed. "Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:</p> <p>and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found</p> <p>it advisable--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.</p> <p></p> <p> `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: `of course you</p> <p>know what "it" means.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said</p> <p>the Duck: `it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is,</p> <p>what did the archbishop find?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,</p> <p>`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William</p> <p>and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was</p> <p>moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you</p> <p>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it</p> <p>spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: `it doesn't</p> <p>seem to dry me at all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I</p> <p>move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more</p> <p>energetic remedies--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak English!' said the Eaglet. `I don't know the meaning of</p> <p>half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do</p> <p>either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:</p> <p>some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p> <p></p> <p> `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,</p> <p>`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much</p> <p>to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY</p> <p>ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'</p> <p>(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter</p> <p>day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p> <p></p> <p> First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the</p> <p>exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party</p> <p>were placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One,</p> <p>two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,</p> <p>and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know</p> <p>when the race was over. However, when they had been running half</p> <p>an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called</p> <p>out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,</p> <p>and asking, `But who has won?'</p> <p></p> <p> This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of</p> <p>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon</p> <p>its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,</p> <p>in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At</p> <p>last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have</p> <p>prizes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices</p> <p>asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with</p> <p>one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,</p> <p>calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand</p> <p>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt</p> <p>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</p> <p>There was exactly one a-piece all round.</p> <p></p> <p> `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have</p> <p>you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.</p> <p></p> <p> Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo</p> <p>solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of</p> <p>this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short</p> <p>speech, they all cheered.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked</p> <p>so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not</p> <p>think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,</p> <p>looking as solemn as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise</p> <p>and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not</p> <p>taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on</p> <p>the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again</p> <p>in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p> <p></p> <p> `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,</p> <p>`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half</p> <p>afraid that it would be offended again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to</p> <p>Alice, and sighing.</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with</p> <p>wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And</p> <p>she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so</p> <p>that her idea of the tale was something like this:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Fury said to a</p> <p> mouse, That he</p> <p> met in the</p> <p> house,</p> <p> "Let us</p> <p> both go to</p> <p> law: I will</p> <p> prosecute</p> <p> YOU. --Come,</p> <p> I'll take no</p> <p> denial; We</p> <p> must have a</p> <p> trial: For</p> <p> really this</p> <p> morning I've</p> <p> nothing</p> <p> to do."</p> <p> Said the</p> <p> mouse to the</p> <p> cur, "Such</p> <p> a trial,</p> <p> dear Sir,</p> <p> With</p> <p> no jury</p> <p> or judge,</p> <p> would be</p> <p> wasting</p> <p> our</p> <p> breath."</p> <p> "I'll be</p> <p> judge, I'll</p> <p> be jury,"</p> <p> Said</p> <p> cunning</p> <p> old Fury:</p> <p> "I'll</p> <p> try the</p> <p> whole</p> <p> cause,</p> <p> and</p> <p> condemn</p> <p> you</p> <p> to</p> <p> death."'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.</p> <p>`What are you thinking of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to</p> <p>the fifth bend, I think?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up</p> <p>and walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily</p> <p>offended, you know!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse only growled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after</p> <p>it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but</p> <p>the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little</p> <p>quicker.</p> <p></p> <p> `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it</p> <p>was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of</p> <p>saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you</p> <p>never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the</p> <p>young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the</p> <p>patience of an oyster!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,</p> <p>addressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'</p> <p>said the Lory.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about</p> <p>her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for</p> <p>catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her</p> <p>after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look</p> <p>at it!'</p> <p></p> <p> This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</p> <p>Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began</p> <p>wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be</p> <p>getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary</p> <p>called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my</p> <p>dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts</p> <p>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a</p> <p>melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm</p> <p>sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I</p> <p>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice</p> <p>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</p> <p>In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of</p> <p>footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping</p> <p>that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to</p> <p>finish his story.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IV</p> <p></p> <p> The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;</p> <p>and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!</p> <p>Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me</p> <p>executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have</p> <p>dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was</p> <p>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she</p> <p>very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were</p> <p>nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her</p> <p>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and</p> <p>the little door, had vanished completely.</p> <p></p> <p> Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,</p> <p>and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE</p> <p>you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of</p> <p>gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened</p> <p>that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without</p> <p>trying to explain the mistake it had made.</p> <p></p> <p> `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.</p> <p>`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd</p> <p>better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'</p> <p>As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door</p> <p>of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'</p> <p>engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried</p> <p>upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,</p> <p>and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and</p> <p>gloves.</p> <p></p> <p> `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going</p> <p>messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on</p> <p>messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that</p> <p>would happen: `"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready</p> <p>for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see</p> <p>that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went</p> <p>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering</p> <p>people about like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with</p> <p>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two</p> <p>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and</p> <p>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when</p> <p>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-</p> <p>glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'</p> <p>but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know</p> <p>SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,</p> <p>`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this</p> <p>bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for</p> <p>really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'</p> <p></p> <p> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:</p> <p>before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing</p> <p>against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being</p> <p>broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself</p> <p>`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I</p> <p>can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so</p> <p>much!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and</p> <p>growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in</p> <p>another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried</p> <p>the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the</p> <p>other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,</p> <p>as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one</p> <p>foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,</p> <p>whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'</p> <p></p> <p> Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full</p> <p>effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,</p> <p>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting</p> <p>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one</p> <p>wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about</p> <p>by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that</p> <p>rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,</p> <p>this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!</p> <p>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing</p> <p>never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There</p> <p>ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when</p> <p>I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more</p> <p>HERE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I</p> <p>am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--</p> <p>but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you</p> <p>learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no</p> <p>room at all for any lesson-books!'</p> <p></p> <p> And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,</p> <p>and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few</p> <p>minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves</p> <p>this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the</p> <p>stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and</p> <p>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she</p> <p>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no</p> <p>reason to be afraid of it.</p> <p></p> <p> Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;</p> <p>but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed</p> <p>hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it</p> <p>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she</p> <p>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly</p> <p>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not</p> <p>get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,</p> <p>and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was</p> <p>just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something</p> <p>of the sort.</p> <p></p> <p> Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are</p> <p>you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then</p> <p>I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!</p> <p>Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')</p> <p></p> <p> `An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it</p> <p>fills the whole window!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it</p> <p>away!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear</p> <p>whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer</p> <p>honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at</p> <p>last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in</p> <p>the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more</p> <p>sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there</p> <p>must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for</p> <p>pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I</p> <p>don't want to stay in here any longer!'</p> <p></p> <p> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at</p> <p>last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a</p> <p>good many voices all talking together: she made out the words:</p> <p>`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;</p> <p>Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up</p> <p>at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half</p> <p>high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--</p> <p>Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind</p> <p>that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud</p> <p>crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go</p> <p>down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,</p> <p>then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to</p> <p>go down the chimney!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said</p> <p>Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!</p> <p>I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is</p> <p>narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'</p> <p></p> <p> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and</p> <p>waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what</p> <p>sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close</p> <p>above her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one</p> <p>sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes</p> <p>Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the</p> <p>hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold</p> <p>up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?</p> <p>What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'</p> <p></p> <p> Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'</p> <p>thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm</p> <p>better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know</p> <p>is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes</p> <p>like a sky-rocket!'</p> <p></p> <p> `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and</p> <p>Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do. I'll set</p> <p>Dinah at you!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to</p> <p>herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any</p> <p>sense, they'd take the roof off.' After a minute or two, they</p> <p>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A</p> <p>barrowful will do, to begin with.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to</p> <p>doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came</p> <p>rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.</p> <p>`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,</p> <p>`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead</p> <p>silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all</p> <p>turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright</p> <p>idea came into her head. `If I eat one of these cakes,' she</p> <p>thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it</p> <p>can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I</p> <p>suppose.'</p> <p></p> <p> So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find</p> <p>that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small</p> <p>enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and</p> <p>found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.</p> <p>The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by</p> <p>two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.</p> <p>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she</p> <p>ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a</p> <p>thick wood.</p> <p></p> <p> `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she</p> <p>wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;</p> <p>and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</p> <p>I think that will be the best plan.'</p> <p></p> <p> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and</p> <p>simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the</p> <p>smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering</p> <p>about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over</p> <p>her head made her look up in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round</p> <p>eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</p> <p>`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried</p> <p>hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the</p> <p>time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it</p> <p>would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</p> <p></p> <p> Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of</p> <p>stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped</p> <p>into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,</p> <p>and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice</p> <p>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run</p> <p>over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy</p> <p>made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in</p> <p>its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very</p> <p>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every</p> <p>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle</p> <p>again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the</p> <p>stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long</p> <p>way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat</p> <p>down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its</p> <p>mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p> <p></p> <p> This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;</p> <p>so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out</p> <p>of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the</p> <p>distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she</p> <p>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself</p> <p>with one of the leaves: `I should have liked teaching it tricks</p> <p>very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh</p> <p>dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let</p> <p>me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or</p> <p>drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'</p> <p></p> <p> The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round</p> <p>her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see</p> <p>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under</p> <p>the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,</p> <p>about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under</p> <p>it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her</p> <p>that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.</p> <p></p> <p> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of</p> <p>the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large</p> <p>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,</p> <p>quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice</p> <p>of her or of anything else.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER V</p> <p></p> <p> Advice from a Caterpillar</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in</p> <p>silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice</p> <p>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--</p> <p>at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think</p> <p>I must have been changed several times since then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</p> <p>`Explain yourself!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because</p> <p>I'm not myself, you see.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very</p> <p>politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and</p> <p>being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but</p> <p>when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you</p> <p>know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll</p> <p>feel it a little queer, won't you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;</p> <p>`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. `Who are YOU?'</p> <p></p> <p> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the</p> <p>conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's</p> <p>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,</p> <p>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not</p> <p>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in</p> <p>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. `I've something</p> <p>important to say!'</p> <p></p> <p> This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as</p> <p>she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else</p> <p>to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth</p> <p>hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but</p> <p>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth</p> <p>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as</p> <p>I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it</p> <p>all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice folded her hands, and began:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,</p> <p> `And your hair has become very white;</p> <p> And yet you incessantly stand on your head--</p> <p> Do you think, at your age, it is right?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,</p> <p> `I feared it might injure the brain;</p> <p> But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,</p> <p> Why, I do it again and again.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,</p> <p> And have grown most uncommonly fat;</p> <p> Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--</p> <p> Pray, what is the reason of that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</p> <p> `I kept all my limbs very supple</p> <p> By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--</p> <p> Allow me to sell you a couple?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak</p> <p> For anything tougher than suet;</p> <p> Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--</p> <p> Pray how did you manage to do it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,</p> <p> And argued each case with my wife;</p> <p> And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,</p> <p> Has lasted the rest of my life.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose</p> <p> That your eye was as steady as ever;</p> <p> Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--</p> <p> What made you so awfully clever?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'</p> <p> Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!</p> <p> Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?</p> <p> Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the</p> <p>words have got altered.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.</p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar was the first to speak.</p> <p></p> <p> `What size do you want to be?' it asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;</p> <p>`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in</p> <p>her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you</p> <p>wouldn't mind,' said Alice: `three inches is such a wretched</p> <p>height to be.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three</p> <p>inches high).</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</p> <p>And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so</p> <p>easily offended!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it</p> <p>put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</p> <p></p> <p> This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</p> <p>In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got</p> <p>down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely</p> <p>remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and</p> <p>the other side will make you grow shorter.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had</p> <p>asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a</p> <p>minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as</p> <p>it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</p> <p>However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they</p> <p>would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p> <p></p> <p> `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a</p> <p>little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment</p> <p>she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her</p> <p>foot!</p> <p></p> <p> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but</p> <p>she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking</p> <p>rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.</p> <p>Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was</p> <p>hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and</p> <p>managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of</p> <p>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she</p> <p>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could</p> <p>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which</p> <p>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay</p> <p>far below her.</p> <p></p> <p> `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. `And where</p> <p>HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I</p> <p>can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no</p> <p>result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the</p> <p>distant green leaves.</p> <p></p> <p> As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her</p> <p>head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted</p> <p>to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,</p> <p>like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a</p> <p>graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which</p> <p>she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she</p> <p>had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a</p> <p>hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating</p> <p>her violently with its wings.</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. `Let me alone!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more</p> <p>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every</p> <p>way, and nothing seems to suit them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've</p> <p>tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but</p> <p>those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no</p> <p>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</p> <p></p> <p> `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the</p> <p>Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and</p> <p>day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was</p> <p>beginning to see its meaning.</p> <p></p> <p> `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued</p> <p>the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was</p> <p>thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come</p> <p>wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. `I'm a--I'm</p> <p>a--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're</p> <p>trying to invent something!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she</p> <p>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the</p> <p>deepest contempt. `I've seen a good many little girls in my</p> <p>time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a</p> <p>serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be</p> <p>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very</p> <p>truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as</p> <p>serpents do, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why</p> <p>then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent</p> <p>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of</p> <p>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and</p> <p>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a</p> <p>serpent?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm</p> <p>not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't</p> <p>want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it</p> <p>settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the</p> <p>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled</p> <p>among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and</p> <p>untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the</p> <p>pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very</p> <p>carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and</p> <p>growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had</p> <p>succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p> <p></p> <p> It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,</p> <p>that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a</p> <p>few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come,</p> <p>there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes</p> <p>are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to</p> <p>another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next</p> <p>thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be</p> <p>done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an</p> <p>open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</p> <p>`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come</p> <p>upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their</p> <p>wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did</p> <p>not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself</p> <p>down to nine inches high.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VI</p> <p></p> <p> Pig and Pepper</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and</p> <p>wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came</p> <p>running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman</p> <p>because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only,</p> <p>she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door</p> <p>with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,</p> <p>with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,</p> <p>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their</p> <p>heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and</p> <p>crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great</p> <p>letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to</p> <p>the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess. An</p> <p>invitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman</p> <p>repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the</p> <p>words a little, `From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess</p> <p>to play croquet.'</p> <p></p> <p> Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled</p> <p>together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into</p> <p>the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped</p> <p>out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the</p> <p>ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and</p> <p>that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the</p> <p>door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise</p> <p>inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was</p> <p>a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling</p> <p>and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish</p> <p>or kettle had been broken to pieces.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'</p> <p></p> <p> `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went</p> <p>on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us. For</p> <p>instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let</p> <p>you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time</p> <p>he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. `But</p> <p>perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so</p> <p>VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might</p> <p>answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate</p> <p>came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just</p> <p>grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees</p> <p>behind him.</p> <p></p> <p> `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,</p> <p>exactly as if nothing had happened.</p> <p></p> <p> `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. `That's the</p> <p>first question, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.</p> <p>`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the</p> <p>creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for</p> <p>repeating his remark, with variations. `I shall sit here,' he</p> <p>said, `on and off, for days and days.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what am I to do?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:</p> <p>`he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.</p> <p></p> <p> The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of</p> <p>smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a</p> <p>three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was</p> <p>leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to</p> <p>be full of soup.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to</p> <p>herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p> <p></p> <p> There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the</p> <p>Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was</p> <p>sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The</p> <p>only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,</p> <p>and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from</p> <p>ear to ear.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for</p> <p>she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to</p> <p>speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!'</p> <p></p> <p> She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice</p> <p>quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed</p> <p>to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I</p> <p>didn't know that cats COULD grin.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,</p> <p>feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</p> <p></p> <p> `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought</p> <p>it would be as well to introduce some other subject of</p> <p>conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took</p> <p>the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work</p> <p>throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby</p> <p>--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,</p> <p>plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when</p> <p>they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it</p> <p>was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up</p> <p>and down in an agony of terror. `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS</p> <p>nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very</p> <p>nearly carried it off.</p> <p></p> <p> `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a</p> <p>hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it</p> <p>does.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very</p> <p>glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her</p> <p>knowledge. `Just think of what work it would make with the day</p> <p>and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn</p> <p>round on its axis--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant</p> <p>to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and</p> <p>seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: `Twenty-four</p> <p>hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide</p> <p>figures!' And with that she began nursing her child again,</p> <p>singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a</p> <p>violent shake at the end of every line:</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak roughly to your little boy,</p> <p> And beat him when he sneezes:</p> <p> He only does it to annoy,</p> <p> Because he knows it teases.'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> (In which the cook and the baby joined):--</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept</p> <p>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing</p> <p>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I speak severely to my boy,</p> <p> I beat him when he sneezes;</p> <p> For he can thoroughly enjoy</p> <p> The pepper when he pleases!'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said</p> <p>to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. `I must go and</p> <p>get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of</p> <p>the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,</p> <p>but it just missed her.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-</p> <p>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all</p> <p>directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor</p> <p>little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,</p> <p>and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,</p> <p>so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much</p> <p>as she could do to hold it.</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,</p> <p>(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep</p> <p>tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its</p> <p>undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. `IF I</p> <p>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure</p> <p>to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it</p> <p>behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing</p> <p>grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). `Don't</p> <p>grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing</p> <p>yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into</p> <p>its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no</p> <p>doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout</p> <p>than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for</p> <p>a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at</p> <p>all. `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked</p> <p>into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</p> <p></p> <p> No, there were no tears. `If you're going to turn into a pig,</p> <p>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do</p> <p>with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or</p> <p>grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for</p> <p>some while in silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I</p> <p>to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted</p> <p>again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some</p> <p>alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was</p> <p>neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be</p> <p>quite absurd for her to carry it further.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to</p> <p>see it trot away quietly into the wood. `If it had grown up,'</p> <p>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:</p> <p>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began</p> <p>thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as</p> <p>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right</p> <p>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing</p> <p>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-</p> <p>natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great</p> <p>many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p> <p></p> <p> `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at</p> <p>all know whether it would like the name: however, it only</p> <p>grinned a little wider. `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought</p> <p>Alice, and she went on. `Would you tell me, please, which way I</p> <p>ought to go from here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said</p> <p>the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't much care where--' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk</p> <p>long enough.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another</p> <p>question. `What sort of people live about here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,</p> <p>`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,</p> <p>`lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.</p> <p>I'm mad. You're mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on</p> <p>`And how do you know that you're mad?'</p> <p></p> <p> `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad. You grant</p> <p>that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I suppose so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's</p> <p>angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm</p> <p>pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call it what you like,' said the Cat. `Do you play croquet</p> <p>with the Queen to-day?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been</p> <p>invited yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used</p> <p>to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place</p> <p>where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.</p> <p></p> <p> `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. `I'd</p> <p>nearly forgotten to ask.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had</p> <p>come back in a natural way.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it</p> <p>did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the</p> <p>direction in which the March Hare was said to live. `I've seen</p> <p>hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be</p> <p>much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be</p> <p>raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.' As she said</p> <p>this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a</p> <p>branch of a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep</p> <p>appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'</p> <p></p> <p> `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,</p> <p>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,</p> <p>which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever</p> <p>saw in my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the</p> <p>house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house,</p> <p>because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was</p> <p>thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not</p> <p>like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand</p> <p>bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even</p> <p>then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself</p> <p>`Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd</p> <p>gone to see the Hatter instead!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VII</p> <p></p> <p> A Mad Tea-Party</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,</p> <p>and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a</p> <p>Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two</p> <p>were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking</p> <p>over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p> <p></p> <p> The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded</p> <p>together at one corner of it: `No room! No room!' they cried</p> <p>out when they saw Alice coming. `There's PLENTY of room!' said</p> <p>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one</p> <p>end of the table.</p> <p></p> <p> `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it</p> <p>but tea. `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice</p> <p>angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being</p> <p>invited,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a</p> <p>great many more than three.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been</p> <p>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was</p> <p>his first speech.</p> <p></p> <p> `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said</p> <p>with some severity; `it's very rude.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all</p> <p>he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. `I'm glad</p> <p>they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she</p> <p>added aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'</p> <p>said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what</p> <p>I say--that's the same thing, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. `You might just</p> <p>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat</p> <p>what I see"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I</p> <p>like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to</p> <p>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the</p> <p>same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the</p> <p>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,</p> <p>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and</p> <p>writing-desks, which wasn't much.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter was the first to break the silence. `What day of</p> <p>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his</p> <p>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking</p> <p>it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. `I told you butter</p> <p>wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March</p> <p>Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter</p> <p>grumbled: `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'</p> <p></p> <p> The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then</p> <p>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he</p> <p>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It</p> <p>was the BEST butter, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</p> <p>`What a funny watch!' she remarked. `It tells the day of the</p> <p>month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. `Does YOUR watch tell</p> <p>you what year it is?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: `but that's</p> <p>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to</p> <p>have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</p> <p>`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she</p> <p>could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured</p> <p>a little hot tea upon its nose.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without</p> <p>opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to</p> <p>remark myself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to</p> <p>Alice again.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I give it up,' Alice replied: `what's the answer?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nor I,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice sighed wearily. `I think you might do something better</p> <p>with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that</p> <p>have no answers.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you</p> <p>wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head</p> <p>contemptuously. `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: `but I know I have to</p> <p>beat time when I learn music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. `He won't stand</p> <p>beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do</p> <p>almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose</p> <p>it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:</p> <p>you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the</p> <p>clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'</p> <p></p> <p> (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a</p> <p>whisper.)</p> <p></p> <p> `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:</p> <p>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: `but you could keep</p> <p>it to half-past one as long as you liked.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter shook his head mournfully. `Not I!' he replied.</p> <p>`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'</p> <p>(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the</p> <p>great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing</p> <p></p> <p> "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</p> <p> How I wonder what you're at!"</p> <p></p> <p>You know the song, perhaps?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--</p> <p></p> <p> "Up above the world you fly,</p> <p> Like a tea-tray in the sky.</p> <p> Twinkle, twinkle--"'</p> <p></p> <p>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep</p> <p>`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that</p> <p>they had to pinch it to make it stop.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,</p> <p>`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the</p> <p>time! Off with his head!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,</p> <p>`he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'</p> <p></p> <p> A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so</p> <p>many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always</p> <p>tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice</p> <p>ventured to ask.</p> <p></p> <p> `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,</p> <p>yawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady</p> <p>tells us a story.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at</p> <p>the proposal.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. `Wake up,</p> <p>Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. `I wasn't asleep,' he</p> <p>said in a hoarse, feeble voice: `I heard every word you fellows</p> <p>were saying.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep</p> <p>again before it's done.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the</p> <p>Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,</p> <p>Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great</p> <p>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</p> <p></p> <p> `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a</p> <p>minute or two.</p> <p></p> <p> `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently</p> <p>remarked; `they'd have been ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways</p> <p>of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went</p> <p>on: `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very</p> <p>earnestly.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so</p> <p>I can't take more.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very</p> <p>easy to take MORE than nothing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked</p> <p>triumphantly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped</p> <p>herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the</p> <p>Dormouse, and repeated her question. `Why did they live at the</p> <p>bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and</p> <p>then said, `It was a treacle-well.'</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but</p> <p>the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse</p> <p>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the</p> <p>story for yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt</p> <p>again. I dare say there may be ONE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he</p> <p>consented to go on. `And so these three little sisters--they</p> <p>were learning to draw, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this</p> <p>time.</p> <p></p> <p> `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: `let's all move</p> <p>one place on.'</p> <p></p> <p> He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the</p> <p>March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather</p> <p>unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the</p> <p>only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a</p> <p>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset</p> <p>the milk-jug into his plate.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began</p> <p>very cautiously: `But I don't understand. Where did they draw</p> <p>the treacle from?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so</p> <p>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,</p> <p>stupid?'</p> <p></p> <p> `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not</p> <p>choosing to notice this last remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'</p> <p></p> <p> This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse</p> <p>go on for some time without interrupting it.</p> <p></p> <p> `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and</p> <p>rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew</p> <p>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why with an M?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why not?' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going</p> <p>off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up</p> <p>again with a little shriek, and went on: `--that begins with an</p> <p>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--</p> <p>you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever</p> <p>see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I</p> <p>don't think--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got</p> <p>up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep</p> <p>instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her</p> <p>going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that</p> <p>they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were</p> <p>trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</p> <p></p> <p> `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she</p> <p>picked her way through the wood. `It's the stupidest tea-party I</p> <p>ever was at in all my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a</p> <p>door leading right into it. `That's very curious!' she thought.</p> <p>`But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.'</p> <p>And in she went.</p> <p></p> <p> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the</p> <p>little glass table. `Now, I'll manage better this time,'</p> <p>she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,</p> <p>and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went</p> <p>to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it</p> <p>in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down</p> <p>the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the</p> <p>beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VIII</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's Croquet-Ground</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the</p> <p>roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at</p> <p>it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious</p> <p>thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up</p> <p>to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go</p> <p>splashing paint over me like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged</p> <p>my elbow.'</p> <p></p> <p> On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always</p> <p>lay the blame on others!'</p> <p></p> <p> `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. `I heard the Queen say only</p> <p>yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it</p> <p>was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'</p> <p></p> <p> Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all</p> <p>the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as</p> <p>she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the</p> <p>others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are</p> <p>painting those roses?'</p> <p></p> <p> Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a</p> <p>low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to</p> <p>have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;</p> <p>and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads</p> <p>cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore</p> <p>she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously</p> <p>looking across the garden, called out `The Queen! The Queen!'</p> <p>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon</p> <p>their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice</p> <p>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped</p> <p>like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and</p> <p>feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were</p> <p>ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the</p> <p>soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were</p> <p>ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand</p> <p>in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next</p> <p>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice</p> <p>recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous</p> <p>manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without</p> <p>noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the</p> <p>King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this</p> <p>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on</p> <p>her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember</p> <p>ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,</p> <p>what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people</p> <p>had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'</p> <p>So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p> <p></p> <p> When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped</p> <p>and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'</p> <p>She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,</p> <p>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'</p> <p></p> <p> `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very</p> <p>politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of</p> <p>cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three</p> <p>gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as</p> <p>they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs</p> <p>was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether</p> <p>they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her</p> <p>own children.</p> <p></p> <p> `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</p> <p>`It's no business of MINE.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her</p> <p>for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!</p> <p>Off--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the</p> <p>Queen was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said</p> <p>`Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave</p> <p>`Turn them over!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p> <p></p> <p> `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the</p> <p>three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the</p> <p>King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</p> <p></p> <p> `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. `You make me giddy.'</p> <p>And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you</p> <p>been doing here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,</p> <p>going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the</p> <p>roses. `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,</p> <p>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate</p> <p>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</p> <p></p> <p> `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a</p> <p>large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered</p> <p>about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly</p> <p>marched off after the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers</p> <p>shouted in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's right!' shouted the Queen. `Can you play croquet?'</p> <p></p> <p> The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question</p> <p>was evidently meant for her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes!' shouted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the</p> <p>procession, wondering very much what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.</p> <p>She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously</p> <p>into her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very,' said Alice: `--where's the Duchess?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He</p> <p>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised</p> <p>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and</p> <p>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I didn't,' said Alice: `I don't think it's at all a pity.</p> <p>I said "What for?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a</p> <p>little scream of laughter. `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a</p> <p>frightened tone. `The Queen will hear you! You see, she came</p> <p>rather late, and the Queen said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,</p> <p>and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up</p> <p>against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or</p> <p>two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a</p> <p>curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and</p> <p>furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live</p> <p>flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to</p> <p>stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p> <p></p> <p> The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her</p> <p>flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,</p> <p>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,</p> <p>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened</p> <p>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it</p> <p>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a</p> <p>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:</p> <p>and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,</p> <p>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled</p> <p>itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,</p> <p>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she</p> <p>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers</p> <p>were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the</p> <p>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very</p> <p>difficult game indeed.</p> <p></p> <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns,</p> <p>quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in</p> <p>a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went</p> <p>stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with</p> <p>her head!' about once in a minute.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as</p> <p>yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might</p> <p>happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of</p> <p>me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great</p> <p>wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'</p> <p></p> <p> She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering</p> <p>whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a</p> <p>curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at</p> <p>first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to</p> <p>be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat: now I</p> <p>shall have somebody to talk to.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was</p> <p>mouth enough for it to speak with.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. `It's no</p> <p>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at</p> <p>least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared,</p> <p>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the</p> <p>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The</p> <p>Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and</p> <p>no more of it appeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather</p> <p>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't</p> <p>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in</p> <p>particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and</p> <p>you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;</p> <p>for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next</p> <p>walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have</p> <p>croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it</p> <p>saw mine coming!'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at all,' said Alice: `she's so extremely--' Just then</p> <p>she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so</p> <p>she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while</p> <p>finishing the game.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen smiled and passed on.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and</p> <p>looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: `allow me</p> <p>to introduce it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:</p> <p>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me</p> <p>like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. `I've read that in</p> <p>some book, but I don't remember where.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and</p> <p>he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear! I</p> <p>wish you would have this cat removed!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great</p> <p>or small. `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking</p> <p>round.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and</p> <p>he hurried off.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game</p> <p>was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,</p> <p>screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three</p> <p>of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and</p> <p>she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in</p> <p>such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or</p> <p>not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p> <p></p> <p> The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,</p> <p>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one</p> <p>of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her</p> <p>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where</p> <p>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up</p> <p>into a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,</p> <p>the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:</p> <p>`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches</p> <p>are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away</p> <p>under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for</p> <p>a little more conversation with her friend.</p> <p></p> <p> When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to</p> <p>find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute</p> <p>going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who</p> <p>were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,</p> <p>and looked very uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to</p> <p>settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,</p> <p>though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed</p> <p>to make out exactly what they said.</p> <p></p> <p> The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a</p> <p>head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had</p> <p>never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin</p> <p>at HIS time of life.</p> <p></p> <p> The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be</p> <p>beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about</p> <p>it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.</p> <p>(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so</p> <p>grave and anxious.)</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the</p> <p>Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: `fetch</p> <p>her here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,</p> <p>by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely</p> <p>disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down</p> <p>looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IX</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle's Story</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old</p> <p>thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately</p> <p>into Alice's, and they walked off together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and</p> <p>thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had</p> <p>made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p> `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very</p> <p>hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT</p> <p>ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that</p> <p>makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at</p> <p>having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them</p> <p>sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar</p> <p>and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish</p> <p>people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you</p> <p>know--'</p> <p></p> <p> She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a</p> <p>little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</p> <p>`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you</p> <p>forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that</p> <p>is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. `Everything's got a</p> <p>moral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up</p> <p>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first,</p> <p>because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was</p> <p>exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,</p> <p>and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not</p> <p>like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of</p> <p>keeping up the conversation a little.</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis so,' said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--"Oh,</p> <p>'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody</p> <p>minding their own business!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,</p> <p>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,</p> <p>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the</p> <p>sounds will take care of themselves."'</p> <p></p> <p> `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your</p> <p>waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I'm</p> <p>doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the</p> <p>experiment?'</p> <p></p> <p> `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all</p> <p>anxious to have the experiment tried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very true,' said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both</p> <p>bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock</p> <p>together."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: `what a clear way you</p> <p>have of putting things!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree</p> <p>to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near</p> <p>here. And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the</p> <p>less there is of yours."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this</p> <p>last remark, `it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it</p> <p>is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of</p> <p>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put</p> <p>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than</p> <p>what it might appear to others that what you were or might have</p> <p>been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared</p> <p>to them to be otherwise."'</p> <p></p> <p> `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very</p> <p>politely, `if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it</p> <p>as you say it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess</p> <p>replied, in a pleased tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'</p> <p>said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. `I make you</p> <p>a present of everything I've said as yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. `I'm glad they don't</p> <p>give birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to</p> <p>say it out loud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her</p> <p>sharp little chin.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was</p> <p>beginning to feel a little worried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;</p> <p>and the m--'</p> <p></p> <p> But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died</p> <p>away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the</p> <p>arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up,</p> <p>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,</p> <p>frowning like a thunderstorm.</p> <p></p> <p> `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on</p> <p>the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,</p> <p>and that in about half no time! Take your choice!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p> <p></p> <p> `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice</p> <p>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her</p> <p>back to the croquet-ground.</p> <p></p> <p> The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,</p> <p>and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her,</p> <p>they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a</p> <p>moment's delay would cost them their lives.</p> <p></p> <p> All the time they were playing the Queen never left off</p> <p>quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his</p> <p>head!' or `Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were</p> <p>taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave</p> <p>off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour</p> <p>or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the</p> <p>King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of</p> <p>execution.</p> <p></p> <p> Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to</p> <p>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said Alice. `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his</p> <p>history,'</p> <p></p> <p> As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low</p> <p>voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.' `Come,</p> <p>THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite</p> <p>unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p> <p></p> <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the</p> <p>sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)</p> <p>`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to</p> <p>see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and</p> <p>see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,</p> <p>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like</p> <p>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would</p> <p>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage</p> <p>Queen: so she waited.</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the</p> <p>Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!'</p> <p>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the fun?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. `It's all her fancy, that: they</p> <p>never executes nobody, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went</p> <p>slowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life,</p> <p>never!'</p> <p></p> <p> They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the</p> <p>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,</p> <p>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart</p> <p>would break. She pitied him deeply. `What is his sorrow?' she</p> <p>asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the</p> <p>same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got</p> <p>no sorrow, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with</p> <p>large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to</p> <p>know your history, she do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow</p> <p>tone: `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've</p> <p>finished.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice</p> <p>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he</p> <p>doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.</p> <p></p> <p> `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was</p> <p>a real Turtle.'</p> <p></p> <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only</p> <p>by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and</p> <p>the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very</p> <p>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your</p> <p>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be</p> <p>more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more</p> <p>calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to</p> <p>school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call</p> <p>him Tortoise--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle angrily: `really you are very dull!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple</p> <p>question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and</p> <p>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At</p> <p>last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!</p> <p>Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe</p> <p>it--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak</p> <p>again. The Mock Turtle went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school</p> <p>every day--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be</p> <p>so proud as all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle in a tone of great relief. `Now at OURS they had at the</p> <p>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'</p> <p></p> <p> `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the</p> <p>bottom of the sea.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a</p> <p>sigh. `I only took the regular course.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was that?' inquired Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock</p> <p>Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--</p> <p>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. `What is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. `What! Never</p> <p>heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. `You know what to beautify is,</p> <p>I suppose?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to</p> <p>uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about</p> <p>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you</p> <p>to learn?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting</p> <p>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,</p> <p>with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old</p> <p>conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us</p> <p>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was THAT like?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: `I'm</p> <p>too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics</p> <p>master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he</p> <p>taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;</p> <p>and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a</p> <p>hurry to change the subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the</p> <p>next, and so on.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon</p> <p>remarked: `because they lessen from day to day.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a</p> <p>little before she made her next remark. `Then the eleventh day</p> <p>must have been a holiday?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a</p> <p>very decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER X</p> <p></p> <p> The Lobster Quadrille</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper</p> <p>across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for</p> <p>a minute or two sobs choked his voice. `Same as if he had a bone</p> <p>in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him</p> <p>and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered</p> <p>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--</p> <p>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'</p> <p>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,</p> <p>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful</p> <p>thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, indeed,' said Alice. `What sort of a dance is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;</p> <p>then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `--you advance twice--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: `advance twice, set to</p> <p>partners--'</p> <p></p> <p> `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the</p> <p>Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</p> <p></p> <p> `--as far out to sea as you can--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,</p> <p>capering wildly about.</p> <p></p> <p> `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the</p> <p>Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,</p> <p>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat</p> <p>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very much indeed,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the</p> <p>Gryphon. `We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall</p> <p>sing?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. `I've forgotten the words.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now</p> <p>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and</p> <p>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle</p> <p>sang this, very slowly and sadly:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>`"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.</p> <p>"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my</p> <p> tail.</p> <p>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</p> <p>They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be</p> <p>When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to</p> <p> sea!"</p> <p>But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look</p> <p> askance--</p> <p>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the</p> <p> dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p></p> <p>`"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.</p> <p>"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.</p> <p>The further off from England the nearer is to France--</p> <p>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</p> <p></p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p> dance?</p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p> dance?"'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said</p> <p>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: `and I do so</p> <p>like that curious song about the whiting!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've</p> <p>seen them, of course?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she</p> <p>checked herself hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but</p> <p>if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're</p> <p>like.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. `They have their</p> <p>tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:</p> <p>`crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails</p> <p>in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle</p> <p>yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all</p> <p>that,' he said to the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with</p> <p>the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So</p> <p>they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in</p> <p>their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting. I never knew</p> <p>so much about a whiting before.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the</p> <p>Gryphon. `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never thought about it,' said Alice. `Why?'</p> <p></p> <p> `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very</p> <p>solemnly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was thoroughly puzzled. `Does the boots and shoes!' she</p> <p>repeated in a wondering tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. `I</p> <p>mean, what makes them so shiny?'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she</p> <p>gave her answer. `They're done with blacking, I believe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep</p> <p>voice, `are done with a whiting. Now you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great</p> <p>curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather</p> <p>impatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were</p> <p>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep</p> <p>back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>said: `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came</p> <p>to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With</p> <p>what porpoise?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended</p> <p>tone. And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR</p> <p>adventures.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'</p> <p>said Alice a little timidly: `but it's no use going back to</p> <p>yesterday, because I was a different person then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an</p> <p>impatient tone: `explanations take such a dreadful time.'</p> <p></p> <p> So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when</p> <p>she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about</p> <p>it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on</p> <p>each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she</p> <p>gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly</p> <p>quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,</p> <p>FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming</p> <p>different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said</p> <p>`That's very curious.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated</p> <p>thoughtfully. `I should like to hear her try and repeat</p> <p>something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as</p> <p>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said</p> <p>the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat</p> <p>lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'</p> <p>However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so</p> <p>full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was</p> <p>saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,</p> <p> "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."</p> <p> As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose</p> <p> Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,</p> <p> And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,</p> <p> But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,</p> <p> His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]</p> <p></p> <p> `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'</p> <p>said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it</p> <p>sounds uncommon nonsense.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her</p> <p>hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. `Go on with</p> <p>the next verse.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. `How COULD</p> <p>he turn them out with his nose, you know?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was</p> <p>dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the</p> <p>subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:</p> <p>`it begins "I passed by his garden."'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would</p> <p>all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,</p> <p> How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,</p> <p> While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</p> <p> When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,</p> <p> Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:</p> <p> While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,</p> <p> And concluded the banquet--]</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far</p> <p>the most confusing thing I ever heard!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and</p> <p>Alice was only too glad to do so.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the</p> <p>Gryphon went on. `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you</p> <p>a song?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'</p> <p>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather</p> <p>offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her</p> <p>"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes</p> <p>choked with sobs, to sing this:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</p> <p> Waiting in a hot tureen!</p> <p> Who for such dainties would not stoop?</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,</p> <p> Game, or any other dish?</p> <p> Who would not give all else for two</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had</p> <p>just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'</p> <p>was heard in the distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,</p> <p>it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</p> <p></p> <p> `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon</p> <p>only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more</p> <p>faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the</p> <p>melancholy words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XI</p> <p></p> <p> Who Stole the Tarts?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when</p> <p>they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts</p> <p>of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:</p> <p>the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on</p> <p>each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,</p> <p>with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the</p> <p>other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large</p> <p>dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice</p> <p>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'</p> <p>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed</p> <p>to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about</p> <p>her, to pass away the time.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had</p> <p>read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that</p> <p>she knew the name of nearly everything there. `That's the</p> <p>judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'</p> <p></p> <p> The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown</p> <p>over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he</p> <p>did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly</p> <p>not becoming.</p> <p></p> <p> `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve</p> <p>creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because</p> <p>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they</p> <p>are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over</p> <p>to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and</p> <p>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the</p> <p>meaning of it at all. However, `jury-men' would have done just</p> <p>as well.</p> <p></p> <p> The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</p> <p>`What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. `They</p> <p>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in</p> <p>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the</p> <p>trial.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but</p> <p>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in</p> <p>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked</p> <p>anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their</p> <p>shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'</p> <p>on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them</p> <p>didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his</p> <p>neighbour to tell him. `A nice muddle their slates'll be in</p> <p>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,</p> <p>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got</p> <p>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it</p> <p>away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was</p> <p>Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of</p> <p>it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write</p> <p>with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very</p> <p>little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p> <p></p> <p> `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and</p> <p>then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--</p> <p></p> <p> `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,</p> <p> All on a summer day:</p> <p> The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,</p> <p> And took them quite away!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. `There's</p> <p>a great deal to come before that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit</p> <p>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First</p> <p>witness!'</p> <p></p> <p> The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in</p> <p>one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. `I beg</p> <p>pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in: but I</p> <p>hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to have finished,' said the King. `When did you</p> <p>begin?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into</p> <p>the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. `Fourteenth of March, I</p> <p>think it was,' he said.</p> <p></p> <p> `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury</p> <p>eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then</p> <p>added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</p> <p></p> <p> `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who</p> <p>instantly made a memorandum of the fact.</p> <p></p> <p> `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;</p> <p>`I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'</p> <p></p> <p> Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or</p> <p>I'll have you executed on the spot.'</p> <p></p> <p> This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept</p> <p>shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the</p> <p>Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his</p> <p>teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.</p> <p></p> <p> Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which</p> <p>puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was</p> <p>beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she</p> <p>would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she</p> <p>decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for</p> <p>her.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was</p> <p>sitting next to her. `I can hardly breathe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: `I'm growing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: `you know</p> <p>you're growing too.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:</p> <p>`not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily</p> <p>and crossed over to the other side of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to</p> <p>one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the</p> <p>singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter</p> <p>trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have</p> <p>you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a</p> <p>trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week</p> <p>or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and</p> <p>the twinkling of the tea--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.</p> <p>`Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things</p> <p>twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did!' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `I deny it!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `He denies it,' said the King: `leave out that part.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,</p> <p>looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the</p> <p>Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</p> <p></p> <p> `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-</p> <p>and-butter--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you</p> <p>executed.'</p> <p></p> <p> The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,</p> <p>and went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he</p> <p>began.</p> <p></p> <p> `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately</p> <p>suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a</p> <p>hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had</p> <p>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:</p> <p>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat</p> <p>upon it.)</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've so often</p> <p>read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some</p> <p>attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the</p> <p>officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant</p> <p>till now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'</p> <p>continued the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as</p> <p>it is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.</p> <p></p> <p> Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. `Now we</p> <p>shall get on better.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious</p> <p>look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</p> <p></p> <p> `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the</p> <p>court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.</p> <p></p> <p> `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one</p> <p>of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the</p> <p>officer could get to the door.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the next witness!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the</p> <p>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before</p> <p>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began</p> <p>sneezing all at once.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shan't,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a</p> <p>low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy</p> <p>air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till</p> <p>his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What</p> <p>are tarts made of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead that</p> <p>Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch</p> <p>him! Off with his whiskers!'</p> <p></p> <p> For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the</p> <p>Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down</p> <p>again, the cook had disappeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.</p> <p>`Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the</p> <p>Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.</p> <p>It quite makes my forehead ache!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,</p> <p>feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,</p> <p>`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.</p> <p>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top</p> <p>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XII</p> <p></p> <p> Alice's Evidence</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the</p> <p>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she</p> <p>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with</p> <p>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads</p> <p>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding</p> <p>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset</p> <p>the week before.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great</p> <p>dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,</p> <p>for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and</p> <p>she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once</p> <p>and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</p> <p></p> <p> `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave</p> <p>voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--</p> <p>ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as</p> <p>he said do.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she</p> <p>had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing</p> <p>was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable</p> <p>to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that</p> <p>it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it</p> <p>would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of</p> <p>being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and</p> <p>handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write</p> <p>out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed</p> <p>too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,</p> <p>gazing up into the roof of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you know about this business?' the King said to</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.</p> <p>They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when</p> <p>the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,</p> <p>of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and</p> <p>making faces at him as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and</p> <p>went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--</p> <p>unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word</p> <p>sounded best.</p> <p></p> <p> Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some</p> <p>`unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to</p> <p>look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she</p> <p>thought to herself.</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily</p> <p>writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out</p> <p>from his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE</p> <p>HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'</p> <p></p> <p> Everybody looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You are,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides,</p> <p>that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</p> <p>`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said</p> <p>the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has</p> <p>just been picked up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What's in it?' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems</p> <p>to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was</p> <p>written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,</p> <p>there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper</p> <p>as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set</p> <p>of verses.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of</p> <p>the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the</p> <p>queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)</p> <p></p> <p> `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.</p> <p>(The jury all brightened up again.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and</p> <p>they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the</p> <p>matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd</p> <p>have signed your name like an honest man.'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the</p> <p>first really clever thing the King had said that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't</p> <p>even know what they're about!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Read them,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,</p> <p>please your Majesty?' he asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on</p> <p>till you come to the end: then stop.'</p> <p></p> <p> These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--</p> <p></p> <p> `They told me you had been to her,</p> <p> And mentioned me to him:</p> <p> She gave me a good character,</p> <p> But said I could not swim.</p> <p></p> <p> He sent them word I had not gone</p> <p> (We know it to be true):</p> <p> If she should push the matter on,</p> <p> What would become of you?</p> <p></p> <p> I gave her one, they gave him two,</p> <p> You gave us three or more;</p> <p> They all returned from him to you,</p> <p> Though they were mine before.</p> <p></p> <p> If I or she should chance to be</p> <p> Involved in this affair,</p> <p> He trusts to you to set them free,</p> <p> Exactly as we were.</p> <p></p> <p> My notion was that you had been</p> <p> (Before she had this fit)</p> <p> An obstacle that came between</p> <p> Him, and ourselves, and it.</p> <p></p> <p> Don't let him know she liked them best,</p> <p> For this must ever be</p> <p> A secret, kept from all the rest,</p> <p> Between yourself and me.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'</p> <p>said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'</p> <p></p> <p> `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had</p> <p>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit</p> <p>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't</p> <p>believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'</p> <p></p> <p> The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe</p> <p>there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to</p> <p>explain the paper.</p> <p></p> <p> `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a</p> <p>world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And</p> <p>yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his</p> <p>knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some</p> <p>meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you</p> <p>can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.</p> <p>(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)</p> <p></p> <p> `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering</p> <p>over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's</p> <p>the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,</p> <p>that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to</p> <p>the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.</p> <p>Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my</p> <p>dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the</p> <p>Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off</p> <p>writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no</p> <p>mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was</p> <p>trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round</p> <p>the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and</p> <p>everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the</p> <p>King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having</p> <p>the sentence first!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't!' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</p> <p>Nobody moved.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full</p> <p>size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'</p> <p></p> <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying</p> <p>down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half</p> <p>of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on</p> <p>the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently</p> <p>brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the</p> <p>trees upon her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long</p> <p>sleep you've had!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told</p> <p>her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange</p> <p>Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and</p> <p>when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a</p> <p>curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's</p> <p>getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she</p> <p>ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</p> <p></p> <p> But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her</p> <p>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of</p> <p>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began</p> <p>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--</p> <p></p> <p> First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the</p> <p>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes</p> <p>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her</p> <p>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back</p> <p>the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and</p> <p>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place</p> <p>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little</p> <p>sister's dream.</p> <p></p> <p> The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried</p> <p>by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the</p> <p>neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as</p> <p>the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,</p> <p>and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate</p> <p>guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the</p> <p>Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once</p> <p>more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's</p> <p>slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,</p> <p>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable</p> <p>Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in</p> <p>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and</p> <p>all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only</p> <p>rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the</p> <p>reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-</p> <p>bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd</p> <p>boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and</p> <p>all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the</p> <p>confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the</p> <p>cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's</p> <p>heavy sobs.</p> <p></p> <p> Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of</p> <p>hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how</p> <p>she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and</p> <p>loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about</p> <p>her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager</p> <p>with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of</p> <p>Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their</p> <p>simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,</p> <p>remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</p> <p></p> <p> THE END</p>
ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND</p> <p></p> <p> Lewis Carroll</p> <p></p> <p> THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER I</p> <p></p> <p> Down the Rabbit-Hole</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister</p> <p>on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had</p> <p>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no</p> <p>pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'</p> <p>thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'</p> <p></p> <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,</p> <p>for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether</p> <p>the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble</p> <p>of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White</p> <p>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p> <p></p> <p> There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice</p> <p>think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to</p> <p>itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought</p> <p>it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have</p> <p>wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);</p> <p>but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-</p> <p>POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to</p> <p>her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never</p> <p>before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to</p> <p>take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the</p> <p>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop</p> <p>down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p> <p></p> <p> In another moment down went Alice after it, never once</p> <p>considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,</p> <p>and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a</p> <p>moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself</p> <p>falling down a very deep well.</p> <p></p> <p> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she</p> <p>had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to</p> <p>wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look</p> <p>down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to</p> <p>see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and</p> <p>noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;</p> <p>here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She</p> <p>took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was</p> <p>labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it</p> <p>was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing</p> <p>somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she</p> <p>fell past it.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I</p> <p>shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll</p> <p>all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,</p> <p>even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely</p> <p>true.)</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! `I</p> <p>wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.</p> <p>`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let</p> <p>me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,</p> <p>you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her</p> <p>lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good</p> <p>opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to</p> <p>listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,</p> <p>that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude</p> <p>or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,</p> <p>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to</p> <p>say.)</p> <p></p> <p> Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right</p> <p>THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the</p> <p>people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I</p> <p>think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this</p> <p>time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall</p> <p>have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.</p> <p>Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried</p> <p>to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling</p> <p>through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what</p> <p>an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll</p> <p>never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon</p> <p>began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I</p> <p>should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember</p> <p>her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were</p> <p>down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but</p> <p>you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.</p> <p>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get</p> <p>rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of</p> <p>way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do</p> <p>bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either</p> <p>question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt</p> <p>that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she</p> <p>was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very</p> <p>earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a</p> <p>bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of</p> <p>sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a</p> <p>moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her</p> <p>was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in</p> <p>sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:</p> <p>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it</p> <p>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late</p> <p>it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the</p> <p>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found</p> <p>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps</p> <p>hanging from the roof.</p> <p></p> <p> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;</p> <p>and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the</p> <p>other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,</p> <p>wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of</p> <p>solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,</p> <p>and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the</p> <p>doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or</p> <p>the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of</p> <p>them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low</p> <p>curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little</p> <p>door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key</p> <p>in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p> <p></p> <p> Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small</p> <p>passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and</p> <p>looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</p> <p>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about</p> <p>among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but</p> <p>she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if</p> <p>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of</p> <p>very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish</p> <p>I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only</p> <p>know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things</p> <p>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few</p> <p>things indeed were really impossible.</p> <p></p> <p> There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she</p> <p>went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on</p> <p>it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like</p> <p>telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which</p> <p>certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck</p> <p>of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'</p> <p>beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p> <p></p> <p> It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little</p> <p>Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look</p> <p>first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';</p> <p>for she had read several nice little histories about children who</p> <p>had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant</p> <p>things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules</p> <p>their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker</p> <p>will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your</p> <p>finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had</p> <p>never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked</p> <p>`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or</p> <p>later.</p> <p></p> <p> However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured</p> <p>to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort</p> <p>of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast</p> <p>turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished</p> <p>it off.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up</p> <p>like a telescope.'</p> <p></p> <p> And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and</p> <p>her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right</p> <p>size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.</p> <p>First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was</p> <p>going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about</p> <p>this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my</p> <p>going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be</p> <p>like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is</p> <p>like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember</p> <p>ever having seen such a thing.</p> <p></p> <p> After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided</p> <p>on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!</p> <p>when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the</p> <p>little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,</p> <p>she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it</p> <p>quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb</p> <p>up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;</p> <p>and when she had tired herself out with trying,</p> <p>the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to</p> <p>herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'</p> <p>She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very</p> <p>seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so</p> <p>severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered</p> <p>trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game</p> <p>of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious</p> <p>child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no</p> <p>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why,</p> <p>there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable</p> <p>person!'</p> <p></p> <p> Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under</p> <p>the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on</p> <p>which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.</p> <p>`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,</p> <p>I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep</p> <p>under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I</p> <p>don't care which happens!'</p> <p></p> <p> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which</p> <p>way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to</p> <p>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to</p> <p>find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally</p> <p>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the</p> <p>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,</p> <p>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the</p> <p>common way.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER II</p> <p></p> <p> The Pool of Tears</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much</p> <p>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good</p> <p>English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that</p> <p>ever was!

(for when she looked down at her</p> <p>feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so</p> <p>far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on</p> <p>your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?

It was as much as she could do, lying down on one</p> <p>side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get</p> <p>through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to</p> <p>cry again.</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great</p> <p>girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in</p> <p>this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all</p> <p>the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool</p> <p>all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the</p> <p>hall.</p> <p></p> <p> After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the</p> <p>distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p> <p>It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a</p> <p>pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the</p> <p>other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to</p> <p>himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she</p> <p>be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate</p> <p>that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit</p> <p>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,</p> <p>sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid</p> <p>gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard</p> <p>as he could go.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very</p> <p>hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:</p> <p>`Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday</p> <p>things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in</p> <p>the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this</p> <p>morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little</p> <p>different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in</p> <p>the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began</p> <p>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age</p> <p>as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of</p> <p>them.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such</p> <p>long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm</p> <p>sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,</p> <p>oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,</p> <p>and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the</p> <p>things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,</p> <p>and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!</p> <p>I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the</p> <p>Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.</p> <p>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,</p> <p>and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been</p> <p>changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'</p> <p>and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,</p> <p>and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and</p> <p>strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--</p> <p></p> <p> `How doth the little crocodile</p> <p> Improve his shining tail,</p> <p> And pour the waters of the Nile</p> <p> On every golden scale!</p> <p></p> <p> `How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p> <p> How neatly spread his claws,</p> <p> And welcome little fishes in</p> <p> With gently smiling jaws!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and</p> <p>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel</p> <p>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little</p> <p>house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so</p> <p>many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm</p> <p>Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their</p> <p>heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look</p> <p>up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I</p> <p>like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down</p> <p>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a</p> <p>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads</p> <p>down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was</p> <p>surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little</p> <p>white kid gloves while she was talking. `How CAN I have done</p> <p>that?' she thought. `I must be growing small again.' She got up</p> <p>and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,</p> <p>as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,</p> <p>and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the</p> <p>cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it</p> <p>hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p> <p></p> <p>`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at</p> <p>the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in</p> <p>existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed</p> <p>back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut</p> <p>again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as</p> <p>before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,</p> <p>`for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare</p> <p>it's too bad, that it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another</p> <p>moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first</p> <p>idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that</p> <p>case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had</p> <p>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general</p> <p>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find</p> <p>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in</p> <p>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and</p> <p>behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that</p> <p>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine</p> <p>feet high.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,</p> <p>trying to find her way out. `I shall be punished for it now, I</p> <p>suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer</p> <p>thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a</p> <p>little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at</p> <p>first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then</p> <p>she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that</p> <p>it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this</p> <p>mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should</p> <p>think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in</p> <p>trying.' So she began: `O Mouse, do you know the way out of</p> <p>this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'</p> <p>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:</p> <p>she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having</p> <p>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a</p> <p>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather</p> <p>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little</p> <p>eyes, but it said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I</p> <p>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the</p> <p>Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had</p> <p>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she</p> <p>began again: `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in</p> <p>her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the</p> <p>water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg</p> <p>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the</p> <p>poor animal's feelings. `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate</p> <p>voice. `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: `don't be</p> <p>angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:</p> <p>I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</p> <p>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,</p> <p>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so</p> <p>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and</p> <p>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital</p> <p>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,</p> <p>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt</p> <p>certain it must be really offended. `We won't talk about her any</p> <p>more if you'd rather not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end</p> <p>of his tail. `As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family</p> <p>always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear</p> <p>the name again!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the</p> <p>subject of conversation. `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'</p> <p>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: `There is</p> <p>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</p> <p>A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly</p> <p>brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and</p> <p>it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I</p> <p>can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you</p> <p>know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!</p> <p>He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the</p> <p>Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and</p> <p>making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p> <p></p> <p> So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear! Do come back</p> <p>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't</p> <p>like them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam</p> <p>slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice</p> <p>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to</p> <p>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll</p> <p>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded</p> <p>with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a</p> <p>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious</p> <p>creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the</p> <p>shore.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER III</p> <p></p> <p> A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the</p> <p>bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their</p> <p>fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and</p> <p>uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they</p> <p>had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed</p> <p>quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with</p> <p>them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had</p> <p>quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,</p> <p>and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';</p> <p>and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,</p> <p>and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no</p> <p>more to be said.</p> <p></p> <p> At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among</p> <p>them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL</p> <p>soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large</p> <p>ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes</p> <p>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad</p> <p>cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?</p> <p>This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!</p> <p>"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was</p> <p>soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been</p> <p>of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very</p> <p>politely: `Did you speak?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought you did,' said the Mouse. `--I proceed. "Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:</p> <p>and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found</p> <p>it advisable--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.</p> <p></p> <p> `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: `of course you</p> <p>know what "it" means.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said</p> <p>the Duck: `it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is,</p> <p>what did the archbishop find?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,</p> <p>`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William</p> <p>and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was</p> <p>moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you</p> <p>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it</p> <p>spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: `it doesn't</p> <p>seem to dry me at all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I</p> <p>move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more</p> <p>energetic remedies--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak English!' said the Eaglet. `I don't know the meaning of</p> <p>half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do</p> <p>either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:</p> <p>some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p> <p></p> <p> `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,</p> <p>`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much</p> <p>to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY</p> <p>ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'</p> <p>(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter</p> <p>day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p> <p></p> <p> First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the</p> <p>exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party</p> <p>were placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One,</p> <p>two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,</p> <p>and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know</p> <p>when the race was over. However, when they had been running half</p> <p>an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called</p> <p>out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,</p> <p>and asking, `But who has won?'</p> <p></p> <p> This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of</p> <p>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon</p> <p>its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,</p> <p>in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At</p> <p>last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have</p> <p>prizes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices</p> <p>asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with</p> <p>one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,</p> <p>calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand</p> <p>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt</p> <p>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</p> <p>There was exactly one a-piece all round.</p> <p></p> <p> `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have</p> <p>you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.</p> <p></p> <p> Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo</p> <p>solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of</p> <p>this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short</p> <p>speech, they all cheered.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked</p> <p>so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not</p> <p>think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,</p> <p>looking as solemn as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise</p> <p>and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not</p> <p>taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on</p> <p>the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again</p> <p>in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p> <p></p> <p> `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,</p> <p>`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half</p> <p>afraid that it would be offended again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to</p> <p>Alice, and sighing.</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with</p> <p>wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And</p> <p>she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so</p> <p>that her idea of the tale was something like this:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Fury said to a</p> <p> mouse, That he</p> <p> met in the</p> <p> house,</p> <p> "Let us</p> <p> both go to</p> <p> law: I will</p> <p> prosecute</p> <p> YOU. --Come,</p> <p> I'll take no</p> <p> denial; We</p> <p> must have a</p> <p> trial: For</p> <p> really this</p> <p> morning I've</p> <p> nothing</p> <p> to do."</p> <p> Said the</p> <p> mouse to the</p> <p> cur, "Such</p> <p> a trial,</p> <p> dear Sir,</p> <p> With</p> <p> no jury</p> <p> or judge,</p> <p> would be</p> <p> wasting</p> <p> our</p> <p> breath."</p> <p> "I'll be</p> <p> judge, I'll</p> <p> be jury,"</p> <p> Said</p> <p> cunning</p> <p> old Fury:</p> <p> "I'll</p> <p> try the</p> <p> whole</p> <p> cause,</p> <p> and</p> <p> condemn</p> <p> you</p> <p> to</p> <p> death."'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.</p> <p>`What are you thinking of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to</p> <p>the fifth bend, I think?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up</p> <p>and walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily</p> <p>offended, you know!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse only growled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after</p> <p>it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but</p> <p>the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little</p> <p>quicker.</p> <p></p> <p> `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it</p> <p>was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of</p> <p>saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you</p> <p>never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the</p> <p>young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the</p> <p>patience of an oyster!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,</p> <p>addressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'</p> <p>said the Lory.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about</p> <p>her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for</p> <p>catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her</p> <p>after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look</p> <p>at it!'</p> <p></p> <p> This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</p> <p>Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began</p> <p>wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be</p> <p>getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary</p> <p>called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my</p> <p>dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts</p> <p>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a</p> <p>melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm</p> <p>sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I</p> <p>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice</p> <p>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</p> <p>In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of</p> <p>footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping</p> <p>that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to</p> <p>finish his story.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IV</p> <p></p> <p> The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;</p> <p>and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!</p> <p>Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me</p> <p>executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have</p> <p>dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was</p> <p>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she</p> <p>very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were</p> <p>nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her</p> <p>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and</p> <p>the little door, had vanished completely.</p> <p></p> <p> Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,</p> <p>and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE</p> <p>you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of</p> <p>gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened</p> <p>that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without</p> <p>trying to explain the mistake it had made.</p> <p></p> <p> `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.</p> <p>`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd</p> <p>better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'</p> <p>As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door</p> <p>of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'</p> <p>engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried</p> <p>upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,</p> <p>and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and</p> <p>gloves.</p> <p></p> <p> `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going</p> <p>messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on</p> <p>messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that</p> <p>would happen: `"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready</p> <p>for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see</p> <p>that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went</p> <p>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering</p> <p>people about like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with</p> <p>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two</p> <p>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and</p> <p>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when</p> <p>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-</p> <p>glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'</p> <p>but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know</p> <p>SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,</p> <p>`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this</p> <p>bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for</p> <p>really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'</p> <p></p> <p> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:</p> <p>before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing</p> <p>against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being</p> <p>broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself</p> <p>`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I</p> <p>can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so</p> <p>much!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and</p> <p>growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in</p> <p>another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried</p> <p>the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the</p> <p>other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,</p> <p>as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one</p> <p>foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,</p> <p>whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'</p> <p></p> <p> Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full</p> <p>effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,</p> <p>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting</p> <p>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one</p> <p>wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about</p> <p>by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that</p> <p>rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,</p> <p>this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!</p> <p>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing</p> <p>never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There</p> <p>ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when</p> <p>I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more</p> <p>HERE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I</p> <p>am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--</p> <p>but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you</p> <p>learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no</p> <p>room at all for any lesson-books!'</p> <p></p> <p> And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,</p> <p>and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few</p> <p>minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves</p> <p>this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the</p> <p>stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and</p> <p>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she</p> <p>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no</p> <p>reason to be afraid of it.</p> <p></p> <p> Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;</p> <p>but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed</p> <p>hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it</p> <p>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she</p> <p>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly</p> <p>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not</p> <p>get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,</p> <p>and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was</p> <p>just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something</p> <p>of the sort.</p> <p></p> <p> Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are</p> <p>you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then</p> <p>I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!</p> <p>Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')</p> <p></p> <p> `An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it</p> <p>fills the whole window!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it</p> <p>away!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear</p> <p>whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer</p> <p>honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at</p> <p>last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in</p> <p>the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more</p> <p>sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there</p> <p>must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for</p> <p>pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I</p> <p>don't want to stay in here any longer!'</p> <p></p> <p> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at</p> <p>last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a</p> <p>good many voices all talking together: she made out the words:</p> <p>`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;</p> <p>Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up</p> <p>at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half</p> <p>high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--</p> <p>Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind</p> <p>that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud</p> <p>crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go</p> <p>down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,</p> <p>then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to</p> <p>go down the chimney!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said</p> <p>Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!</p> <p>I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is</p> <p>narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'</p> <p></p> <p> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and</p> <p>waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what</p> <p>sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close</p> <p>above her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one</p> <p>sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes</p> <p>Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the</p> <p>hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold</p> <p>up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?</p> <p>What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'</p> <p></p> <p> Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'</p> <p>thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm</p> <p>better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know</p> <p>is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes</p> <p>like a sky-rocket!'</p> <p></p> <p> `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and</p> <p>Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do. I'll set</p> <p>Dinah at you!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to</p> <p>herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any</p> <p>sense, they'd take the roof off.' After a minute or two, they</p> <p>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A</p> <p>barrowful will do, to begin with.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to</p> <p>doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came</p> <p>rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.</p> <p>`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,</p> <p>`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead</p> <p>silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all</p> <p>turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright</p> <p>idea came into her head. `If I eat one of these cakes,' she</p> <p>thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it</p> <p>can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I</p> <p>suppose.'</p> <p></p> <p> So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find</p> <p>that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small</p> <p>enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and</p> <p>found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.</p> <p>The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by</p> <p>two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.</p> <p>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she</p> <p>ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a</p> <p>thick wood.</p> <p></p> <p> `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she</p> <p>wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;</p> <p>and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</p> <p>I think that will be the best plan.'</p> <p></p> <p> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and</p> <p>simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the</p> <p>smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering</p> <p>about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over</p> <p>her head made her look up in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round</p> <p>eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</p> <p>`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried</p> <p>hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the</p> <p>time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it</p> <p>would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</p> <p></p> <p> Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of</p> <p>stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped</p> <p>into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,</p> <p>and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice</p> <p>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run</p> <p>over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy</p> <p>made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in</p> <p>its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very</p> <p>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every</p> <p>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle</p> <p>again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the</p> <p>stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long</p> <p>way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat</p> <p>down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its</p> <p>mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p> <p></p> <p> This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;</p> <p>so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out</p> <p>of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the</p> <p>distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she</p> <p>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself</p> <p>with one of the leaves: `I should have liked teaching it tricks</p> <p>very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh</p> <p>dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let</p> <p>me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or</p> <p>drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'</p> <p></p> <p> The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round</p> <p>her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see</p> <p>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under</p> <p>the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,</p> <p>about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under</p> <p>it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her</p> <p>that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.</p> <p></p> <p> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of</p> <p>the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large</p> <p>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,</p> <p>quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice</p> <p>of her or of anything else.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER V</p> <p></p> <p> Advice from a Caterpillar</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in</p> <p>silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice</p> <p>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--</p> <p>at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think</p> <p>I must have been changed several times since then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</p> <p>`Explain yourself!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because</p> <p>I'm not myself, you see.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very</p> <p>politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and</p> <p>being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but</p> <p>when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you</p> <p>know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll</p> <p>feel it a little queer, won't you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;</p> <p>`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. `Who are YOU?'</p> <p></p> <p> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the</p> <p>conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's</p> <p>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,</p> <p>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not</p> <p>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in</p> <p>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. `I've something</p> <p>important to say!'</p> <p></p> <p> This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as</p> <p>she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else</p> <p>to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth</p> <p>hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but</p> <p>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth</p> <p>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as</p> <p>I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it</p> <p>all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice folded her hands, and began:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,</p> <p> `And your hair has become very white;</p> <p> And yet you incessantly stand on your head--</p> <p> Do you think, at your age, it is right?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,</p> <p> `I feared it might injure the brain;</p> <p> But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,</p> <p> Why, I do it again and again.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,</p> <p> And have grown most uncommonly fat;</p> <p> Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--</p> <p> Pray, what is the reason of that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</p> <p> `I kept all my limbs very supple</p> <p> By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--</p> <p> Allow me to sell you a couple?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak</p> <p> For anything tougher than suet;</p> <p> Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--</p> <p> Pray how did you manage to do it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,</p> <p> And argued each case with my wife;</p> <p> And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,</p> <p> Has lasted the rest of my life.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose</p> <p> That your eye was as steady as ever;</p> <p> Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--</p> <p> What made you so awfully clever?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'</p> <p> Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!</p> <p> Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?</p> <p> Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the</p> <p>words have got altered.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.</p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar was the first to speak.</p> <p></p> <p> `What size do you want to be?' it asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;</p> <p>`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in</p> <p>her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you</p> <p>wouldn't mind,' said Alice: `three inches is such a wretched</p> <p>height to be.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three</p> <p>inches high).</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</p> <p>And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so</p> <p>easily offended!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it</p> <p>put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</p> <p></p> <p> This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</p> <p>In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got</p> <p>down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely</p> <p>remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and</p> <p>the other side will make you grow shorter.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had</p> <p>asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a</p> <p>minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as</p> <p>it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</p> <p>However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they</p> <p>would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p> <p></p> <p> `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a</p> <p>little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment</p> <p>she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her</p> <p>foot!</p> <p></p> <p> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but</p> <p>she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking</p> <p>rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.</p> <p>Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was</p> <p>hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and</p> <p>managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of</p> <p>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she</p> <p>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could</p> <p>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which</p> <p>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay</p> <p>far below her.</p> <p></p> <p> `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. `And where</p> <p>HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I</p> <p>can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no</p> <p>result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the</p> <p>distant green leaves.</p> <p></p> <p> As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her</p> <p>head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted</p> <p>to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,</p> <p>like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a</p> <p>graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which</p> <p>she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she</p> <p>had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a</p> <p>hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating</p> <p>her violently with its wings.</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. `Let me alone!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more</p> <p>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every</p> <p>way, and nothing seems to suit them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've</p> <p>tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but</p> <p>those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no</p> <p>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</p> <p></p> <p> `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the</p> <p>Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and</p> <p>day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was</p> <p>beginning to see its meaning.</p> <p></p> <p> `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued</p> <p>the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was</p> <p>thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come</p> <p>wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. `I'm a--I'm</p> <p>a--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're</p> <p>trying to invent something!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she</p> <p>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the</p> <p>deepest contempt. `I've seen a good many little girls in my</p> <p>time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a</p> <p>serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be</p> <p>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very</p> <p>truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as</p> <p>serpents do, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why</p> <p>then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent</p> <p>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of</p> <p>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and</p> <p>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a</p> <p>serpent?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm</p> <p>not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't</p> <p>want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it</p> <p>settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the</p> <p>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled</p> <p>among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and</p> <p>untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the</p> <p>pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very</p> <p>carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and</p> <p>growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had</p> <p>succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p> <p></p> <p> It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,</p> <p>that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a</p> <p>few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come,</p> <p>there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes</p> <p>are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to</p> <p>another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next</p> <p>thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be</p> <p>done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an</p> <p>open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</p> <p>`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come</p> <p>upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their</p> <p>wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did</p> <p>not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself</p> <p>down to nine inches high.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VI</p> <p></p> <p> Pig and Pepper</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and</p> <p>wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came</p> <p>running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman</p> <p>because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only,</p> <p>she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door</p> <p>with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,</p> <p>with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,</p> <p>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their</p> <p>heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and</p> <p>crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great</p> <p>letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to</p> <p>the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess. An</p> <p>invitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman</p> <p>repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the</p> <p>words a little, `From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess</p> <p>to play croquet.'</p> <p></p> <p> Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled</p> <p>together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into</p> <p>the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped</p> <p>out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the</p> <p>ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and</p> <p>that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the</p> <p>door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise</p> <p>inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was</p> <p>a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling</p> <p>and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish</p> <p>or kettle had been broken to pieces.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'</p> <p></p> <p> `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went</p> <p>on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us. For</p> <p>instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let</p> <p>you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time</p> <p>he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. `But</p> <p>perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so</p> <p>VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might</p> <p>answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate</p> <p>came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just</p> <p>grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees</p> <p>behind him.</p> <p></p> <p> `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,</p> <p>exactly as if nothing had happened.</p> <p></p> <p> `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. `That's the</p> <p>first question, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.</p> <p>`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the</p> <p>creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for</p> <p>repeating his remark, with variations. `I shall sit here,' he</p> <p>said, `on and off, for days and days.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what am I to do?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:</p> <p>`he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.</p> <p></p> <p> The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of</p> <p>smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a</p> <p>three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was</p> <p>leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to</p> <p>be full of soup.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to</p> <p>herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p> <p></p> <p> There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the</p> <p>Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was</p> <p>sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The</p> <p>only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,</p> <p>and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from</p> <p>ear to ear.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for</p> <p>she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to</p> <p>speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!'</p> <p></p> <p> She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice</p> <p>quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed</p> <p>to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I</p> <p>didn't know that cats COULD grin.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,</p> <p>feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</p> <p></p> <p> `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought</p> <p>it would be as well to introduce some other subject of</p> <p>conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took</p> <p>the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work</p> <p>throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby</p> <p>--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,</p> <p>plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when</p> <p>they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it</p> <p>was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up</p> <p>and down in an agony of terror. `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS</p> <p>nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very</p> <p>nearly carried it off.</p> <p></p> <p> `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a</p> <p>hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it</p> <p>does.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very</p> <p>glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her</p> <p>knowledge. `Just think of what work it would make with the day</p> <p>and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn</p> <p>round on its axis--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant</p> <p>to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and</p> <p>seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: `Twenty-four</p> <p>hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide</p> <p>figures!' And with that she began nursing her child again,</p> <p>singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a</p> <p>violent shake at the end of every line:</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak roughly to your little boy,</p> <p> And beat him when he sneezes:</p> <p> He only does it to annoy,</p> <p> Because he knows it teases.'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> (In which the cook and the baby joined):--</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept</p> <p>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing</p> <p>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I speak severely to my boy,</p> <p> I beat him when he sneezes;</p> <p> For he can thoroughly enjoy</p> <p> The pepper when he pleases!'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said</p> <p>to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. `I must go and</p> <p>get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of</p> <p>the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,</p> <p>but it just missed her.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-</p> <p>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all</p> <p>directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor</p> <p>little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,</p> <p>and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,</p> <p>so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much</p> <p>as she could do to hold it.</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,</p> <p>(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep</p> <p>tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its</p> <p>undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. `IF I</p> <p>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure</p> <p>to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it</p> <p>behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing</p> <p>grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). `Don't</p> <p>grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing</p> <p>yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into</p> <p>its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no</p> <p>doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout</p> <p>than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for</p> <p>a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at</p> <p>all. `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked</p> <p>into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</p> <p></p> <p> No, there were no tears. `If you're going to turn into a pig,</p> <p>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do</p> <p>with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or</p> <p>grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for</p> <p>some while in silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I</p> <p>to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted</p> <p>again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some</p> <p>alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was</p> <p>neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be</p> <p>quite absurd for her to carry it further.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to</p> <p>see it trot away quietly into the wood. `If it had grown up,'</p> <p>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:</p> <p>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began</p> <p>thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as</p> <p>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right</p> <p>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing</p> <p>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-</p> <p>natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great</p> <p>many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p> <p></p> <p> `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at</p> <p>all know whether it would like the name: however, it only</p> <p>grinned a little wider. `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought</p> <p>Alice, and she went on. `Would you tell me, please, which way I</p> <p>ought to go from here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said</p> <p>the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't much care where--' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk</p> <p>long enough.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another</p> <p>question. `What sort of people live about here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,</p> <p>`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,</p> <p>`lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.</p> <p>I'm mad. You're mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on</p> <p>`And how do you know that you're mad?'</p> <p></p> <p> `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad. You grant</p> <p>that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I suppose so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's</p> <p>angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm</p> <p>pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call it what you like,' said the Cat. `Do you play croquet</p> <p>with the Queen to-day?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been</p> <p>invited yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used</p> <p>to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place</p> <p>where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.</p> <p></p> <p> `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. `I'd</p> <p>nearly forgotten to ask.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had</p> <p>come back in a natural way.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it</p> <p>did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the</p> <p>direction in which the March Hare was said to live. `I've seen</p> <p>hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be</p> <p>much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be</p> <p>raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.' As she said</p> <p>this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a</p> <p>branch of a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep</p> <p>appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'</p> <p></p> <p> `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,</p> <p>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,</p> <p>which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever</p> <p>saw in my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the</p> <p>house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house,</p> <p>because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was</p> <p>thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not</p> <p>like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand</p> <p>bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even</p> <p>then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself</p> <p>`Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd</p> <p>gone to see the Hatter instead!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VII</p> <p></p> <p> A Mad Tea-Party</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,</p> <p>and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a</p> <p>Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two</p> <p>were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking</p> <p>over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p> <p></p> <p> The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded</p> <p>together at one corner of it: `No room! No room!' they cried</p> <p>out when they saw Alice coming. `There's PLENTY of room!' said</p> <p>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one</p> <p>end of the table.</p> <p></p> <p> `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it</p> <p>but tea. `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice</p> <p>angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being</p> <p>invited,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a</p> <p>great many more than three.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been</p> <p>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was</p> <p>his first speech.</p> <p></p> <p> `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said</p> <p>with some severity; `it's very rude.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all</p> <p>he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. `I'm glad</p> <p>they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she</p> <p>added aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'</p> <p>said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what</p> <p>I say--that's the same thing, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. `You might just</p> <p>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat</p> <p>what I see"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I</p> <p>like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to</p> <p>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the</p> <p>same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the</p> <p>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,</p> <p>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and</p> <p>writing-desks, which wasn't much.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter was the first to break the silence. `What day of</p> <p>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his</p> <p>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking</p> <p>it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. `I told you butter</p> <p>wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March</p> <p>Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter</p> <p>grumbled: `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'</p> <p></p> <p> The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then</p> <p>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he</p> <p>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It</p> <p>was the BEST butter, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</p> <p>`What a funny watch!' she remarked. `It tells the day of the</p> <p>month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. `Does YOUR watch tell</p> <p>you what year it is?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: `but that's</p> <p>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to</p> <p>have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</p> <p>`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she</p> <p>could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured</p> <p>a little hot tea upon its nose.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without</p> <p>opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to</p> <p>remark myself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to</p> <p>Alice again.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I give it up,' Alice replied: `what's the answer?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nor I,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice sighed wearily. `I think you might do something better</p> <p>with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that</p> <p>have no answers.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you</p> <p>wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head</p> <p>contemptuously. `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: `but I know I have to</p> <p>beat time when I learn music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. `He won't stand</p> <p>beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do</p> <p>almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose</p> <p>it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:</p> <p>you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the</p> <p>clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'</p> <p></p> <p> (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a</p> <p>whisper.)</p> <p></p> <p> `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:</p> <p>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: `but you could keep</p> <p>it to half-past one as long as you liked.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter shook his head mournfully. `Not I!' he replied.</p> <p>`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'</p> <p>(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the</p> <p>great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing</p> <p></p> <p> "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</p> <p> How I wonder what you're at!"</p> <p></p> <p>You know the song, perhaps?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--</p> <p></p> <p> "Up above the world you fly,</p> <p> Like a tea-tray in the sky.</p> <p> Twinkle, twinkle--"'</p> <p></p> <p>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep</p> <p>`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that</p> <p>they had to pinch it to make it stop.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,</p> <p>`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the</p> <p>time! Off with his head!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,</p> <p>`he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'</p> <p></p> <p> A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so</p> <p>many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always</p> <p>tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice</p> <p>ventured to ask.</p> <p></p> <p> `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,</p> <p>yawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady</p> <p>tells us a story.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at</p> <p>the proposal.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. `Wake up,</p> <p>Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. `I wasn't asleep,' he</p> <p>said in a hoarse, feeble voice: `I heard every word you fellows</p> <p>were saying.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep</p> <p>again before it's done.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the</p> <p>Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,</p> <p>Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great</p> <p>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</p> <p></p> <p> `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a</p> <p>minute or two.</p> <p></p> <p> `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently</p> <p>remarked; `they'd have been ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways</p> <p>of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went</p> <p>on: `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very</p> <p>earnestly.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so</p> <p>I can't take more.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very</p> <p>easy to take MORE than nothing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked</p> <p>triumphantly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped</p> <p>herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the</p> <p>Dormouse, and repeated her question. `Why did they live at the</p> <p>bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and</p> <p>then said, `It was a treacle-well.'</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but</p> <p>the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse</p> <p>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the</p> <p>story for yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt</p> <p>again. I dare say there may be ONE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he</p> <p>consented to go on. `And so these three little sisters--they</p> <p>were learning to draw, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this</p> <p>time.</p> <p></p> <p> `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: `let's all move</p> <p>one place on.'</p> <p></p> <p> He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the</p> <p>March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather</p> <p>unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the</p> <p>only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a</p> <p>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset</p> <p>the milk-jug into his plate.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began</p> <p>very cautiously: `But I don't understand. Where did they draw</p> <p>the treacle from?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so</p> <p>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,</p> <p>stupid?'</p> <p></p> <p> `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not</p> <p>choosing to notice this last remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'</p> <p></p> <p> This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse</p> <p>go on for some time without interrupting it.</p> <p></p> <p> `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and</p> <p>rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew</p> <p>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why with an M?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why not?' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going</p> <p>off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up</p> <p>again with a little shriek, and went on: `--that begins with an</p> <p>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--</p> <p>you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever</p> <p>see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I</p> <p>don't think--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got</p> <p>up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep</p> <p>instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her</p> <p>going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that</p> <p>they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were</p> <p>trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</p> <p></p> <p> `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she</p> <p>picked her way through the wood. `It's the stupidest tea-party I</p> <p>ever was at in all my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a</p> <p>door leading right into it. `That's very curious!' she thought.</p> <p>`But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.'</p> <p>And in she went.</p> <p></p> <p> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the</p> <p>little glass table. `Now, I'll manage better this time,'</p> <p>she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,</p> <p>and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went</p> <p>to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it</p> <p>in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down</p> <p>the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the</p> <p>beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VIII</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's Croquet-Ground</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the</p> <p>roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at</p> <p>it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious</p> <p>thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up</p> <p>to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go</p> <p>splashing paint over me like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged</p> <p>my elbow.'</p> <p></p> <p> On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always</p> <p>lay the blame on others!'</p> <p></p> <p> `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. `I heard the Queen say only</p> <p>yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it</p> <p>was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'</p> <p></p> <p> Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all</p> <p>the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as</p> <p>she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the</p> <p>others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are</p> <p>painting those roses?'</p> <p></p> <p> Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a</p> <p>low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to</p> <p>have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;</p> <p>and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads</p> <p>cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore</p> <p>she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously</p> <p>looking across the garden, called out `The Queen! The Queen!'</p> <p>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon</p> <p>their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice</p> <p>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped</p> <p>like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and</p> <p>feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were</p> <p>ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the</p> <p>soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were</p> <p>ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand</p> <p>in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next</p> <p>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice</p> <p>recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous</p> <p>manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without</p> <p>noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the</p> <p>King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this</p> <p>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on</p> <p>her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember</p> <p>ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,</p> <p>what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people</p> <p>had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'</p> <p>So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p> <p></p> <p> When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped</p> <p>and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'</p> <p>She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,</p> <p>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'</p> <p></p> <p> `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very</p> <p>politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of</p> <p>cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three</p> <p>gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as</p> <p>they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs</p> <p>was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether</p> <p>they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her</p> <p>own children.</p> <p></p> <p> `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</p> <p>`It's no business of MINE.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her</p> <p>for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!</p> <p>Off--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the</p> <p>Queen was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said</p> <p>`Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave</p> <p>`Turn them over!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p> <p></p> <p> `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the</p> <p>three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the</p> <p>King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</p> <p></p> <p> `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. `You make me giddy.'</p> <p>And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you</p> <p>been doing here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,</p> <p>going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the</p> <p>roses. `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,</p> <p>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate</p> <p>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</p> <p></p> <p> `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a</p> <p>large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered</p> <p>about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly</p> <p>marched off after the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers</p> <p>shouted in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's right!' shouted the Queen. `Can you play croquet?'</p> <p></p> <p> The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question</p> <p>was evidently meant for her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes!' shouted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the</p> <p>procession, wondering very much what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.</p> <p>She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously</p> <p>into her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very,' said Alice: `--where's the Duchess?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He</p> <p>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised</p> <p>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and</p> <p>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I didn't,' said Alice: `I don't think it's at all a pity.</p> <p>I said "What for?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a</p> <p>little scream of laughter. `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a</p> <p>frightened tone. `The Queen will hear you! You see, she came</p> <p>rather late, and the Queen said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,</p> <p>and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up</p> <p>against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or</p> <p>two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a</p> <p>curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and</p> <p>furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live</p> <p>flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to</p> <p>stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p> <p></p> <p> The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her</p> <p>flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,</p> <p>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,</p> <p>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened</p> <p>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it</p> <p>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a</p> <p>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:</p> <p>and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,</p> <p>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled</p> <p>itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,</p> <p>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she</p> <p>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers</p> <p>were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the</p> <p>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very</p> <p>difficult game indeed.</p> <p></p> <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns,</p> <p>quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in</p> <p>a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went</p> <p>stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with</p> <p>her head!' about once in a minute.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as</p> <p>yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might</p> <p>happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of</p> <p>me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great</p> <p>wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'</p> <p></p> <p> She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering</p> <p>whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a</p> <p>curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at</p> <p>first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to</p> <p>be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat: now I</p> <p>shall have somebody to talk to.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was</p> <p>mouth enough for it to speak with.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. `It's no</p> <p>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at</p> <p>least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared,</p> <p>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the</p> <p>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The</p> <p>Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and</p> <p>no more of it appeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather</p> <p>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't</p> <p>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in</p> <p>particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and</p> <p>you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;</p> <p>for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next</p> <p>walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have</p> <p>croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it</p> <p>saw mine coming!'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at all,' said Alice: `she's so extremely--' Just then</p> <p>she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so</p> <p>she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while</p> <p>finishing the game.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen smiled and passed on.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and</p> <p>looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: `allow me</p> <p>to introduce it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:</p> <p>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me</p> <p>like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. `I've read that in</p> <p>some book, but I don't remember where.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and</p> <p>he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear! I</p> <p>wish you would have this cat removed!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great</p> <p>or small. `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking</p> <p>round.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and</p> <p>he hurried off.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game</p> <p>was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,</p> <p>screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three</p> <p>of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and</p> <p>she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in</p> <p>such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or</p> <p>not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p> <p></p> <p> The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,</p> <p>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one</p> <p>of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her</p> <p>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where</p> <p>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up</p> <p>into a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,</p> <p>the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:</p> <p>`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches</p> <p>are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away</p> <p>under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for</p> <p>a little more conversation with her friend.</p> <p></p> <p> When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to</p> <p>find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute</p> <p>going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who</p> <p>were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,</p> <p>and looked very uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to</p> <p>settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,</p> <p>though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed</p> <p>to make out exactly what they said.</p> <p></p> <p> The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a</p> <p>head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had</p> <p>never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin</p> <p>at HIS time of life.</p> <p></p> <p> The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be</p> <p>beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about</p> <p>it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.</p> <p>(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so</p> <p>grave and anxious.)</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the</p> <p>Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: `fetch</p> <p>her here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,</p> <p>by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely</p> <p>disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down</p> <p>looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IX</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle's Story</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old</p> <p>thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately</p> <p>into Alice's, and they walked off together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and</p> <p>thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had</p> <p>made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p> `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very</p> <p>hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT</p> <p>ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that</p> <p>makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at</p> <p>having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them</p> <p>sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar</p> <p>and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish</p> <p>people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you</p> <p>know--'</p> <p></p> <p> She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a</p> <p>little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</p> <p>`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you</p> <p>forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that</p> <p>is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. `Everything's got a</p> <p>moral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up</p> <p>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first,</p> <p>because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was</p> <p>exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,</p> <p>and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not</p> <p>like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of</p> <p>keeping up the conversation a little.</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis so,' said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--"Oh,</p> <p>'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody</p> <p>minding their own business!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,</p> <p>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,</p> <p>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the</p> <p>sounds will take care of themselves."'</p> <p></p> <p> `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your</p> <p>waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I'm</p> <p>doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the</p> <p>experiment?'</p> <p></p> <p> `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all</p> <p>anxious to have the experiment tried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very true,' said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both</p> <p>bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock</p> <p>together."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: `what a clear way you</p> <p>have of putting things!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree</p> <p>to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near</p> <p>here. And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the</p> <p>less there is of yours."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this</p> <p>last remark, `it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it</p> <p>is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of</p> <p>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put</p> <p>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than</p> <p>what it might appear to others that what you were or might have</p> <p>been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared</p> <p>to them to be otherwise."'</p> <p></p> <p> `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very</p> <p>politely, `if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it</p> <p>as you say it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess</p> <p>replied, in a pleased tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'</p> <p>said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. `I make you</p> <p>a present of everything I've said as yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. `I'm glad they don't</p> <p>give birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to</p> <p>say it out loud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her</p> <p>sharp little chin.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was</p> <p>beginning to feel a little worried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;</p> <p>and the m--'</p> <p></p> <p> But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died</p> <p>away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the</p> <p>arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up,</p> <p>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,</p> <p>frowning like a thunderstorm.</p> <p></p> <p> `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on</p> <p>the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,</p> <p>and that in about half no time! Take your choice!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p> <p></p> <p> `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice</p> <p>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her</p> <p>back to the croquet-ground.</p> <p></p> <p> The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,</p> <p>and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her,</p> <p>they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a</p> <p>moment's delay would cost them their lives.</p> <p></p> <p> All the time they were playing the Queen never left off</p> <p>quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his</p> <p>head!' or `Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were</p> <p>taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave</p> <p>off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour</p> <p>or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the</p> <p>King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of</p> <p>execution.</p> <p></p> <p> Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to</p> <p>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said Alice. `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his</p> <p>history,'</p> <p></p> <p> As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low</p> <p>voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.' `Come,</p> <p>THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite</p> <p>unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p> <p></p> <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the</p> <p>sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)</p> <p>`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to</p> <p>see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and</p> <p>see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,</p> <p>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like</p> <p>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would</p> <p>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage</p> <p>Queen: so she waited.</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the</p> <p>Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!'</p> <p>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the fun?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. `It's all her fancy, that: they</p> <p>never executes nobody, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went</p> <p>slowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life,</p> <p>never!'</p> <p></p> <p> They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the</p> <p>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,</p> <p>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart</p> <p>would break. She pitied him deeply. `What is his sorrow?' she</p> <p>asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the</p> <p>same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got</p> <p>no sorrow, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with</p> <p>large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to</p> <p>know your history, she do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow</p> <p>tone: `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've</p> <p>finished.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice</p> <p>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he</p> <p>doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.</p> <p></p> <p> `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was</p> <p>a real Turtle.'</p> <p></p> <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only</p> <p>by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and</p> <p>the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very</p> <p>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your</p> <p>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be</p> <p>more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more</p> <p>calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to</p> <p>school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call</p> <p>him Tortoise--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle angrily: `really you are very dull!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple</p> <p>question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and</p> <p>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At</p> <p>last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!</p> <p>Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe</p> <p>it--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak</p> <p>again. The Mock Turtle went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school</p> <p>every day--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be</p> <p>so proud as all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle in a tone of great relief. `Now at OURS they had at the</p> <p>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'</p> <p></p> <p> `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the</p> <p>bottom of the sea.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a</p> <p>sigh. `I only took the regular course.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was that?' inquired Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock</p> <p>Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--</p> <p>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. `What is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. `What! Never</p> <p>heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. `You know what to beautify is,</p> <p>I suppose?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to</p> <p>uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about</p> <p>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you</p> <p>to learn?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting</p> <p>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,</p> <p>with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old</p> <p>conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us</p> <p>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was THAT like?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: `I'm</p> <p>too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics</p> <p>master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he</p> <p>taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;</p> <p>and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a</p> <p>hurry to change the subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the</p> <p>next, and so on.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon</p> <p>remarked: `because they lessen from day to day.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a</p> <p>little before she made her next remark. `Then the eleventh day</p> <p>must have been a holiday?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a</p> <p>very decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER X</p> <p></p> <p> The Lobster Quadrille</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper</p> <p>across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for</p> <p>a minute or two sobs choked his voice. `Same as if he had a bone</p> <p>in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him</p> <p>and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered</p> <p>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--</p> <p>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'</p> <p>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,</p> <p>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful</p> <p>thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, indeed,' said Alice. `What sort of a dance is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;</p> <p>then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `--you advance twice--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: `advance twice, set to</p> <p>partners--'</p> <p></p> <p> `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the</p> <p>Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</p> <p></p> <p> `--as far out to sea as you can--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,</p> <p>capering wildly about.</p> <p></p> <p> `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the</p> <p>Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,</p> <p>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat</p> <p>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very much indeed,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the</p> <p>Gryphon. `We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall</p> <p>sing?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. `I've forgotten the words.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now</p> <p>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and</p> <p>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle</p> <p>sang this, very slowly and sadly:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>`"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.</p> <p>"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my</p> <p> tail.</p> <p>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</p> <p>They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be</p> <p>When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to</p> <p> sea!"</p> <p>But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look</p> <p> askance--</p> <p>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the</p> <p> dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p></p> <p>`"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.</p> <p>"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.</p> <p>The further off from England the nearer is to France--</p> <p>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</p> <p></p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p> dance?</p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p> dance?"'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said</p> <p>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: `and I do so</p> <p>like that curious song about the whiting!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've</p> <p>seen them, of course?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she</p> <p>checked herself hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but</p> <p>if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're</p> <p>like.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. `They have their</p> <p>tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:</p> <p>`crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails</p> <p>in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle</p> <p>yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all</p> <p>that,' he said to the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with</p> <p>the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So</p> <p>they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in</p> <p>their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting. I never knew</p> <p>so much about a whiting before.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the</p> <p>Gryphon. `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never thought about it,' said Alice. `Why?'</p> <p></p> <p> `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very</p> <p>solemnly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was thoroughly puzzled. `Does the boots and shoes!' she</p> <p>repeated in a wondering tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. `I</p> <p>mean, what makes them so shiny?'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she</p> <p>gave her answer. `They're done with blacking, I believe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep</p> <p>voice, `are done with a whiting. Now you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great</p> <p>curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather</p> <p>impatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were</p> <p>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep</p> <p>back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>said: `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came</p> <p>to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With</p> <p>what porpoise?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended</p> <p>tone. And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR</p> <p>adventures.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'</p> <p>said Alice a little timidly: `but it's no use going back to</p> <p>yesterday, because I was a different person then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an</p> <p>impatient tone: `explanations take such a dreadful time.'</p> <p></p> <p> So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when</p> <p>she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about</p> <p>it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on</p> <p>each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she</p> <p>gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly</p> <p>quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,</p> <p>FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming</p> <p>different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said</p> <p>`That's very curious.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated</p> <p>thoughtfully. `I should like to hear her try and repeat</p> <p>something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as</p> <p>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said</p> <p>the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat</p> <p>lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'</p> <p>However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so</p> <p>full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was</p> <p>saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,</p> <p> "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."</p> <p> As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose</p> <p> Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,</p> <p> And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,</p> <p> But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,</p> <p> His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]</p> <p></p> <p> `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'</p> <p>said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it</p> <p>sounds uncommon nonsense.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her</p> <p>hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. `Go on with</p> <p>the next verse.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. `How COULD</p> <p>he turn them out with his nose, you know?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was</p> <p>dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the</p> <p>subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:</p> <p>`it begins "I passed by his garden."'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would</p> <p>all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,</p> <p> How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,</p> <p> While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</p> <p> When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,</p> <p> Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:</p> <p> While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,</p> <p> And concluded the banquet--]</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far</p> <p>the most confusing thing I ever heard!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and</p> <p>Alice was only too glad to do so.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the</p> <p>Gryphon went on. `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you</p> <p>a song?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'</p> <p>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather</p> <p>offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her</p> <p>"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes</p> <p>choked with sobs, to sing this:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</p> <p> Waiting in a hot tureen!</p> <p> Who for such dainties would not stoop?</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,</p> <p> Game, or any other dish?</p> <p> Who would not give all else for two</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had</p> <p>just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'</p> <p>was heard in the distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,</p> <p>it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</p> <p></p> <p> `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon</p> <p>only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more</p> <p>faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the</p> <p>melancholy words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XI</p> <p></p> <p> Who Stole the Tarts?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when</p> <p>they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts</p> <p>of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:</p> <p>the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on</p> <p>each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,</p> <p>with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the</p> <p>other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large</p> <p>dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice</p> <p>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'</p> <p>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed</p> <p>to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about</p> <p>her, to pass away the time.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had</p> <p>read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that</p> <p>she knew the name of nearly everything there. `That's the</p> <p>judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'</p> <p></p> <p> The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown</p> <p>over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he</p> <p>did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly</p> <p>not becoming.</p> <p></p> <p> `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve</p> <p>creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because</p> <p>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they</p> <p>are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over</p> <p>to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and</p> <p>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the</p> <p>meaning of it at all. However, `jury-men' would have done just</p> <p>as well.</p> <p></p> <p> The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</p> <p>`What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. `They</p> <p>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in</p> <p>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the</p> <p>trial.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but</p> <p>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in</p> <p>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked</p> <p>anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their</p> <p>shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'</p> <p>on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them</p> <p>didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his</p> <p>neighbour to tell him. `A nice muddle their slates'll be in</p> <p>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,</p> <p>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got</p> <p>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it</p> <p>away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was</p> <p>Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of</p> <p>it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write</p> <p>with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very</p> <p>little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p> <p></p> <p> `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and</p> <p>then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--</p> <p></p> <p> `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,</p> <p> All on a summer day:</p> <p> The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,</p> <p> And took them quite away!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. `There's</p> <p>a great deal to come before that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit</p> <p>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First</p> <p>witness!'</p> <p></p> <p> The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in</p> <p>one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. `I beg</p> <p>pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in: but I</p> <p>hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to have finished,' said the King. `When did you</p> <p>begin?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into</p> <p>the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. `Fourteenth of March, I</p> <p>think it was,' he said.</p> <p></p> <p> `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury</p> <p>eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then</p> <p>added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</p> <p></p> <p> `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who</p> <p>instantly made a memorandum of the fact.</p> <p></p> <p> `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;</p> <p>`I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'</p> <p></p> <p> Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or</p> <p>I'll have you executed on the spot.'</p> <p></p> <p> This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept</p> <p>shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the</p> <p>Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his</p> <p>teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.</p> <p></p> <p> Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which</p> <p>puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was</p> <p>beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she</p> <p>would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she</p> <p>decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for</p> <p>her.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was</p> <p>sitting next to her. `I can hardly breathe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: `I'm growing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: `you know</p> <p>you're growing too.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:</p> <p>`not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily</p> <p>and crossed over to the other side of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to</p> <p>one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the</p> <p>singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter</p> <p>trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have</p> <p>you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a</p> <p>trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week</p> <p>or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and</p> <p>the twinkling of the tea--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.</p> <p>`Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things</p> <p>twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did!' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `I deny it!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `He denies it,' said the King: `leave out that part.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,</p> <p>looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the</p> <p>Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</p> <p></p> <p> `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-</p> <p>and-butter--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you</p> <p>executed.'</p> <p></p> <p> The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,</p> <p>and went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he</p> <p>began.</p> <p></p> <p> `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately</p> <p>suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a</p> <p>hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had</p> <p>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:</p> <p>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat</p> <p>upon it.)</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've so often</p> <p>read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some</p> <p>attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the</p> <p>officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant</p> <p>till now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'</p> <p>continued the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as</p> <p>it is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.</p> <p></p> <p> Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. `Now we</p> <p>shall get on better.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious</p> <p>look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</p> <p></p> <p> `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the</p> <p>court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.</p> <p></p> <p> `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one</p> <p>of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the</p> <p>officer could get to the door.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the next witness!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the</p> <p>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before</p> <p>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began</p> <p>sneezing all at once.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shan't,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a</p> <p>low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy</p> <p>air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till</p> <p>his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What</p> <p>are tarts made of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead that</p> <p>Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch</p> <p>him! Off with his whiskers!'</p> <p></p> <p> For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the</p> <p>Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down</p> <p>again, the cook had disappeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.</p> <p>`Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the</p> <p>Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.</p> <p>It quite makes my forehead ache!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,</p> <p>feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,</p> <p>`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.</p> <p>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top</p> <p>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XII</p> <p></p> <p> Alice's Evidence</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the</p> <p>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she</p> <p>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with</p> <p>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads</p> <p>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding</p> <p>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset</p> <p>the week before.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great</p> <p>dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,</p> <p>for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and</p> <p>she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once</p> <p>and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</p> <p></p> <p> `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave</p> <p>voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--</p> <p>ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as</p> <p>he said do.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she</p> <p>had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing</p> <p>was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable</p> <p>to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that</p> <p>it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it</p> <p>would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of</p> <p>being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and</p> <p>handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write</p> <p>out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed</p> <p>too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,</p> <p>gazing up into the roof of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you know about this business?' the King said to</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.</p> <p>They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when</p> <p>the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,</p> <p>of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and</p> <p>making faces at him as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and</p> <p>went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--</p> <p>unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word</p> <p>sounded best.</p> <p></p> <p> Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some</p> <p>`unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to</p> <p>look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she</p> <p>thought to herself.</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily</p> <p>writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out</p> <p>from his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE</p> <p>HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'</p> <p></p> <p> Everybody looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You are,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides,</p> <p>that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</p> <p>`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said</p> <p>the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has</p> <p>just been picked up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What's in it?' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems</p> <p>to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was</p> <p>written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,</p> <p>there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper</p> <p>as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set</p> <p>of verses.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of</p> <p>the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the</p> <p>queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)</p> <p></p> <p> `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.</p> <p>(The jury all brightened up again.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and</p> <p>they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the</p> <p>matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd</p> <p>have signed your name like an honest man.'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the</p> <p>first really clever thing the King had said that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't</p> <p>even know what they're about!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Read them,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,</p> <p>please your Majesty?' he asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on</p> <p>till you come to the end: then stop.'</p> <p></p> <p> These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--</p> <p></p> <p> `They told me you had been to her,</p> <p> And mentioned me to him:</p> <p> She gave me a good character,</p> <p> But said I could not swim.</p> <p></p> <p> He sent them word I had not gone</p> <p> (We know it to be true):</p> <p> If she should push the matter on,</p> <p> What would become of you?</p> <p></p> <p> I gave her one, they gave him two,</p> <p> You gave us three or more;</p> <p> They all returned from him to you,</p> <p> Though they were mine before.</p> <p></p> <p> If I or she should chance to be</p> <p> Involved in this affair,</p> <p> He trusts to you to set them free,</p> <p> Exactly as we were.</p> <p></p> <p> My notion was that you had been</p> <p> (Before she had this fit)</p> <p> An obstacle that came between</p> <p> Him, and ourselves, and it.</p> <p></p> <p> Don't let him know she liked them best,</p> <p> For this must ever be</p> <p> A secret, kept from all the rest,</p> <p> Between yourself and me.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'</p> <p>said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'</p> <p></p> <p> `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had</p> <p>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit</p> <p>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't</p> <p>believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'</p> <p></p> <p> The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe</p> <p>there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to</p> <p>explain the paper.</p> <p></p> <p> `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a</p> <p>world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And</p> <p>yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his</p> <p>knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some</p> <p>meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you</p> <p>can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.</p> <p>(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)</p> <p></p> <p> `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering</p> <p>over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's</p> <p>the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,</p> <p>that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to</p> <p>the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.</p> <p>Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my</p> <p>dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the</p> <p>Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off</p> <p>writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no</p> <p>mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was</p> <p>trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round</p> <p>the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and</p> <p>everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the</p> <p>King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having</p> <p>the sentence first!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't!' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</p> <p>Nobody moved.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full</p> <p>size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'</p> <p></p> <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying</p> <p>down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half</p> <p>of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on</p> <p>the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently</p> <p>brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the</p> <p>trees upon her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long</p> <p>sleep you've had!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told</p> <p>her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange</p> <p>Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and</p> <p>when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a</p> <p>curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's</p> <p>getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she</p> <p>ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</p> <p></p> <p> But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her</p> <p>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of</p> <p>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began</p> <p>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--</p> <p></p> <p> First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the</p> <p>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes</p> <p>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her</p> <p>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back</p> <p>the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and</p> <p>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place</p> <p>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little</p> <p>sister's dream.</p> <p></p> <p> The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried</p> <p>by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the</p> <p>neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as</p> <p>the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,</p> <p>and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate</p> <p>guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the</p> <p>Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once</p> <p>more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's</p> <p>slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,</p> <p>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable</p> <p>Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in</p> <p>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and</p> <p>all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only</p> <p>rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the</p> <p>reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-</p> <p>bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd</p> <p>boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and</p> <p>all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the</p> <p>confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the</p> <p>cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's</p> <p>heavy sobs.</p> <p></p> <p> Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of</p> <p>hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how</p> <p>she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and</p> <p>loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about</p> <p>her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager</p> <p>with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of</p> <p>Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their</p> <p>simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,</p> <p>remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</p> <p></p> <p> THE END</p>
ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND</p> <p></p> <p> Lewis Carroll</p> <p></p> <p> THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER I</p> <p></p> <p> Down the Rabbit-Hole</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister</p> <p>on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had</p> <p>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no</p> <p>pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'</p> <p>thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'</p> <p></p> <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,</p> <p>for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether</p> <p>the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble</p> <p>of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White</p> <p>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p> <p></p> <p> There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice</p> <p>think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to</p> <p>itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought</p> <p>it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have</p> <p>wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);</p> <p>but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-</p> <p>POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to</p> <p>her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never</p> <p>before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to</p> <p>take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the</p> <p>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop</p> <p>down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p> <p></p> <p> In another moment down went Alice after it, never once</p> <p>considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,</p> <p>and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a</p> <p>moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself</p> <p>falling down a very deep well.</p> <p></p> <p> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she</p> <p>had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to</p> <p>wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look</p> <p>down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to</p> <p>see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and</p> <p>noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;</p> <p>here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She</p> <p>took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was</p> <p>labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it</p> <p>was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing</p> <p>somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she</p> <p>fell past it.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I</p> <p>shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll</p> <p>all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,</p> <p>even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely</p> <p>true.)</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! `I</p> <p>wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.</p> <p>`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let</p> <p>me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,</p> <p>you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her</p> <p>lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good</p> <p>opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to</p> <p>listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,</p> <p>that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude</p> <p>or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,</p> <p>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to</p> <p>say.)</p> <p></p> <p> Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right</p> <p>THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the</p> <p>people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I</p> <p>think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this</p> <p>time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall</p> <p>have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.</p> <p>Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried</p> <p>to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling</p> <p>through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what</p> <p>an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll</p> <p>never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon</p> <p>began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I</p> <p>should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember</p> <p>her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were</p> <p>down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but</p> <p>you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.</p> <p>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get</p> <p>rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of</p> <p>way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do</p> <p>bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either</p> <p>question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt</p> <p>that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she</p> <p>was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very</p> <p>earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a</p> <p>bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of</p> <p>sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a</p> <p>moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her</p> <p>was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in</p> <p>sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:</p> <p>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it</p> <p>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late</p> <p>it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the</p> <p>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found</p> <p>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps</p> <p>hanging from the roof.</p> <p></p> <p> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;</p> <p>and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the</p> <p>other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,</p> <p>wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of</p> <p>solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,</p> <p>and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the</p> <p>doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or</p> <p>the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of</p> <p>them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low</p> <p>curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little</p> <p>door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key</p> <p>in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p> <p></p> <p> Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small</p> <p>passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and</p> <p>looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</p> <p>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about</p> <p>among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but</p> <p>she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if</p> <p>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of</p> <p>very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish</p> <p>I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only</p> <p>know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things</p> <p>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few</p> <p>things indeed were really impossible.</p> <p></p> <p> There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she</p> <p>went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on</p> <p>it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like</p> <p>telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which</p> <p>certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck</p> <p>of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'</p> <p>beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p> <p></p> <p> It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little</p> <p>Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look</p> <p>first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';</p> <p>for she had read several nice little histories about children who</p> <p>had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant</p> <p>things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules</p> <p>their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker</p> <p>will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your</p> <p>finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had</p> <p>never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked</p> <p>`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or</p> <p>later.</p> <p></p> <p> However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured</p> <p>to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort</p> <p>of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast</p> <p>turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished</p> <p>it off.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up</p> <p>like a telescope.'</p> <p></p> <p> And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and</p> <p>her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right</p> <p>size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.</p> <p>First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was</p> <p>going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about</p> <p>this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my</p> <p>going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be</p> <p>like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is</p> <p>like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember</p> <p>ever having seen such a thing.</p> <p></p> <p> After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided</p> <p>on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!</p> <p>when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the</p> <p>little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,</p> <p>she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it</p> <p>quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb</p> <p>up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;</p> <p>and when she had tired herself out with trying,</p> <p>the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to</p> <p>herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'</p> <p>She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very</p> <p>seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so</p> <p>severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered</p> <p>trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game</p> <p>of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious</p> <p>child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no</p> <p>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why,</p> <p>there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable</p> <p>person!'</p> <p></p> <p> Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under</p> <p>the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on</p> <p>which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.</p> <p>`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,</p> <p>I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep</p> <p>under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I</p> <p>don't care which happens!'</p> <p></p> <p> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which</p> <p>way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to</p> <p>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to</p> <p>find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally</p> <p>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the</p> <p>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,</p> <p>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the</p> <p>common way.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER II</p> <p></p> <p> The Pool of Tears</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much</p> <p>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good</p> <p>English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that</p> <p>ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her</p> <p>feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so</p> <p>far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on</p> <p>your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't</p> <p>be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself</p> <p>about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be</p> <p>kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the</p> <p>way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of</p> <p>boots every Christmas.'</p> <p></p> <p> And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.</p> <p>`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll</p> <p>seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the</p> <p>directions will look!</p> <p></p> <p> ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</p> <p> HEARTHRUG,</p> <p> NEAR THE FENDER,</p> <p> (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).</p> <p></p> <p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in</p> <p>fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took</p> <p>up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p> <p></p> <p> Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one</p> <p>side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get</p> <p>through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to</p> <p>cry again.</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great</p> <p>girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in</p> <p>this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all</p> <p>the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool</p> <p>all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the</p> <p>hall.</p> <p></p> <p> After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the</p> <p>distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p> <p>It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a</p> <p>pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the</p> <p>other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to</p> <p>himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she</p> <p>be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate</p> <p>that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit</p> <p>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,</p> <p>sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid</p> <p>gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard</p> <p>as he could go.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very</p> <p>hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:</p> <p>`Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday</p> <p>things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in</p> <p>the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this</p> <p>morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little</p> <p>different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in</p> <p>the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began</p> <p>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age</p> <p>as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of</p> <p>them.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such</p> <p>long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm</p> <p>sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,</p> <p>oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,</p> <p>and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the</p> <p>things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,</p> <p>and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!</p> <p>I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the</p> <p>Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.</p> <p>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,</p> <p>and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been</p> <p>changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'</p> <p>and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,</p> <p>and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and</p> <p>strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--</p> <p></p> <p> `How doth the little crocodile</p> <p> Improve his shining tail,</p> <p> And pour the waters of the Nile</p> <p> On every golden scale!</p> <p></p> <p> `How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p> <p> How neatly spread his claws,</p> <p> And welcome little fishes in</p> <p> With gently smiling jaws!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and</p> <p>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel</p> <p>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little</p> <p>house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so</p> <p>many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm</p> <p>Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their</p> <p>heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look</p> <p>up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I</p> <p>like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down</p> <p>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a</p> <p>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads</p> <p>down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was</p> <p>surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little</p> <p>white kid gloves while she was talking. `How CAN I have done</p> <p>that?' she thought. `I must be growing small again.' She got up</p> <p>and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,</p> <p>as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,</p> <p>and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the</p> <p>cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it</p> <p>hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p> <p></p> <p>`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at</p> <p>the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in</p> <p>existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed</p> <p>back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut</p> <p>again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as</p> <p>before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,</p> <p>`for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare</p> <p>it's too bad, that it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another</p> <p>moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first</p> <p>idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that</p> <p>case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had</p> <p>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general</p> <p>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find</p> <p>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in</p> <p>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and</p> <p>behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that</p> <p>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine</p> <p>feet high.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,</p> <p>trying to find her way out. `I shall be punished for it now, I</p> <p>suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer</p> <p>thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a</p> <p>little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at</p> <p>first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then</p> <p>she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that</p> <p>it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this</p> <p>mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should</p> <p>think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in</p> <p>trying.' So she began: `O Mouse, do you know the way out of</p> <p>this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'</p> <p>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:</p> <p>she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having</p> <p>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a</p> <p>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather</p> <p>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little</p> <p>eyes, but it said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I</p> <p>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the</p> <p>Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had</p> <p>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she</p> <p>began again: `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in</p> <p>her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the</p> <p>water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg</p> <p>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the</p> <p>poor animal's feelings. `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate</p> <p>voice. `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: `don't be</p> <p>angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:</p> <p>I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</p> <p>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,</p> <p>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so</p> <p>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and</p> <p>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital</p> <p>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,</p> <p>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt</p> <p>certain it must be really offended. `We won't talk about her any</p> <p>more if you'd rather not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end</p> <p>of his tail. `As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family</p> <p>always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear</p> <p>the name again!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the</p> <p>subject of conversation. `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'</p> <p>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: `There is</p> <p>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</p> <p>A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly</p> <p>brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and</p> <p>it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I</p> <p>can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you</p> <p>know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!</p> <p>He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the</p> <p>Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and</p> <p>making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p> <p></p> <p> So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear! Do come back</p> <p>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't</p> <p>like them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam</p> <p>slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice</p> <p>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to</p> <p>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll</p> <p>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded</p> <p>with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a</p> <p>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious</p> <p>creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the</p> <p>shore.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER III</p> <p></p> <p> A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the</p> <p>bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their</p> <p>fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and</p> <p>uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they</p> <p>had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed</p> <p>quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with</p> <p>them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had</p> <p>quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,</p> <p>and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';</p> <p>and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,</p> <p>and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no</p> <p>more to be said.</p> <p></p> <p> At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among</p> <p>them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL</p> <p>soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large</p> <p>ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes</p> <p>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad</p> <p>cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?</p> <p>This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!</p> <p>"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was</p> <p>soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been</p> <p>of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very</p> <p>politely: `Did you speak?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought you did,' said the Mouse. `--I proceed. "Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:</p> <p>and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found</p> <p>it advisable--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.</p> <p></p> <p> `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: `of course you</p> <p>know what "it" means.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said</p> <p>the Duck: `it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is,</p> <p>what did the archbishop find?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,</p> <p>`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William</p> <p>and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was</p> <p>moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you</p> <p>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it</p> <p>spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: `it doesn't</p> <p>seem to dry me at all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I</p> <p>move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more</p> <p>energetic remedies--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak English!' said the Eaglet. `I don't know the meaning of</p> <p>half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do</p> <p>either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:</p> <p>some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p> <p></p> <p> `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,</p> <p>`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much</p> <p>to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY</p> <p>ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'</p> <p>(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter</p> <p>day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p> <p></p> <p> First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the</p> <p>exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party</p> <p>were placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One,</p> <p>two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,</p> <p>and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know</p> <p>when the race was over. However, when they had been running half</p> <p>an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called</p> <p>out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,</p> <p>and asking, `But who has won?'</p> <p></p> <p> This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of</p> <p>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon</p> <p>its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,</p> <p>in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At</p> <p>last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have</p> <p>prizes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices</p> <p>asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with</p> <p>one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,</p> <p>calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand</p> <p>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt</p> <p>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</p> <p>There was exactly one a-piece all round.</p> <p></p> <p> `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have</p> <p>you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.</p> <p></p> <p> Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo</p> <p>solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of</p> <p>this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short</p> <p>speech, they all cheered.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked</p> <p>so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not</p> <p>think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,</p> <p>looking as solemn as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise</p> <p>and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not</p> <p>taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on</p> <p>the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again</p> <p>in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p> <p></p> <p> `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,</p> <p>`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half</p> <p>afraid that it would be offended again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to</p> <p>Alice, and sighing.</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with</p> <p>wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And</p> <p>she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so</p> <p>that her idea of the tale was something like this:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Fury said to a</p> <p> mouse, That he</p> <p> met in the</p> <p> house,</p> <p> "Let us</p> <p> both go to</p> <p> law: I will</p> <p> prosecute</p> <p> YOU. --Come,</p> <p> I'll take no</p> <p> denial; We</p> <p> must have a</p> <p> trial: For</p> <p> really this</p> <p> morning I've</p> <p> nothing</p> <p> to do."</p> <p> Said the</p> <p> mouse to the</p> <p> cur, "Such</p> <p> a trial,</p> <p> dear Sir,</p> <p> With</p> <p> no jury</p> <p> or judge,</p> <p> would be</p> <p> wasting</p> <p> our</p> <p> breath."</p> <p> "I'll be</p> <p> judge, I'll</p> <p> be jury,"</p> <p> Said</p> <p> cunning</p> <p> old Fury:</p> <p> "I'll</p> <p> try the</p> <p> whole</p> <p> cause,</p> <p> and</p> <p> condemn</p> <p> you</p> <p> to</p> <p> death."'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.</p> <p>`What are you thinking of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to</p> <p>the fifth bend, I think?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up</p> <p>and walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily</p> <p>offended, you know!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse only growled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after</p> <p>it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but</p> <p>the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little</p> <p>quicker.</p> <p></p> <p> `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it</p> <p>was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of</p> <p>saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you</p> <p>never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the</p> <p>young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the</p> <p>patience of an oyster!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,</p> <p>addressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'</p> <p>said the Lory.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about</p> <p>her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for</p> <p>catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her</p> <p>after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look</p> <p>at it!'</p> <p></p> <p> This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</p> <p>Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began</p> <p>wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be</p> <p>getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary</p> <p>called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my</p> <p>dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts</p> <p>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a</p> <p>melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm</p> <p>sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I</p> <p>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice</p> <p>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</p> <p>In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of</p> <p>footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping</p> <p>that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to</p> <p>finish his story.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IV</p> <p></p> <p> The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;</p> <p>and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!</p> <p>Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me</p> <p>executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have</p> <p>dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was</p> <p>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she</p> <p>very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were</p> <p>nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her</p> <p>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and</p> <p>the little door, had vanished completely.</p> <p></p> <p> Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,</p> <p>and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE</p> <p>you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of</p> <p>gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened</p> <p>that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without</p> <p>trying to explain the mistake it had made.</p> <p></p> <p> `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.</p> <p>`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd</p> <p>better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'</p> <p>As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door</p> <p>of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'</p> <p>engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried</p> <p>upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,</p> <p>and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and</p> <p>gloves.</p> <p></p> <p> `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going</p> <p>messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on</p> <p>messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that</p> <p>would happen: `"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready</p> <p>for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see</p> <p>that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went</p> <p>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering</p> <p>people about like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with</p> <p>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two</p> <p>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and</p> <p>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when</p> <p>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-</p> <p>glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'</p> <p>but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know</p> <p>SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,</p> <p>`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this</p> <p>bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for</p> <p>really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'</p> <p></p> <p> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:</p> <p>before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing</p> <p>against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being</p> <p>broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself</p> <p>`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I</p> <p>can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so</p> <p>much!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and</p> <p>growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in</p> <p>another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried</p> <p>the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the</p> <p>other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,</p> <p>as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one</p> <p>foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,</p> <p>whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'</p> <p></p> <p> Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full</p> <p>effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,</p> <p>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting</p> <p>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one</p> <p>wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about</p> <p>by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that</p> <p>rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,</p> <p>this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!</p> <p>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing</p> <p>never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There</p> <p>ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when</p> <p>I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more</p> <p>HERE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I</p> <p>am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--</p> <p>but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you</p> <p>learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no</p> <p>room at all for any lesson-books!'</p> <p></p> <p> And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,</p> <p>and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few</p> <p>minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves</p> <p>this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the</p> <p>stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and</p> <p>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she</p> <p>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no</p> <p>reason to be afraid of it.</p> <p></p> <p> Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;</p> <p>but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed</p> <p>hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it</p> <p>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she</p> <p>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly</p> <p>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not</p> <p>get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,</p> <p>and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was</p> <p>just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something</p> <p>of the sort.</p> <p></p> <p> Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are</p> <p>you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then</p> <p>I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!</p> <p>Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')</p> <p></p> <p> `An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it</p> <p>fills the whole window!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it</p> <p>away!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear</p> <p>whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer</p> <p>honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at</p> <p>last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in</p> <p>the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more</p> <p>sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there</p> <p>must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for</p> <p>pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I</p> <p>don't want to stay in here any longer!'</p> <p></p> <p> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at</p> <p>last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a</p> <p>good many voices all talking together: she made out the words:</p> <p>`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;</p> <p>Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up</p> <p>at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half</p> <p>high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--</p> <p>Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind</p> <p>that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud</p> <p>crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go</p> <p>down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,</p> <p>then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to</p> <p>go down the chimney!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said</p> <p>Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!</p> <p>I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is</p> <p>narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'</p> <p></p> <p> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and</p> <p>waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what</p> <p>sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close</p> <p>above her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one</p> <p>sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes</p> <p>Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the</p> <p>hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold</p> <p>up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?</p> <p>What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'</p> <p></p> <p> Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'</p> <p>thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm</p> <p>better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know</p> <p>is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes</p> <p>like a sky-rocket!'</p> <p></p> <p> `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and</p> <p>Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do. I'll set</p> <p>Dinah at you!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to</p> <p>herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any</p> <p>sense, they'd take the roof off.' After a minute or two, they</p> <p>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A</p> <p>barrowful will do, to begin with.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to</p> <p>doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came</p> <p>rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.</p> <p>`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,</p> <p>`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead</p> <p>silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all</p> <p>turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright</p> <p>idea came into her head. `If I eat one of these cakes,' she</p> <p>thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it</p> <p>can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I</p> <p>suppose.'</p> <p></p> <p> So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find</p> <p>that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small</p> <p>enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and</p> <p>found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.</p> <p>The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by</p> <p>two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.</p> <p>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she</p> <p>ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a</p> <p>thick wood.</p> <p></p> <p> `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she</p> <p>wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;</p> <p>and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</p> <p>I think that will be the best plan.'</p> <p></p> <p> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and</p> <p>simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the</p> <p>smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering</p> <p>about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over</p> <p>her head made her look up in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round</p> <p>eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</p> <p>`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried</p> <p>hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the</p> <p>time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it</p> <p>would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</p> <p></p> <p> Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of</p> <p>stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped</p> <p>into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,</p> <p>and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice</p> <p>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run</p> <p>over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy</p> <p>made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in</p> <p>its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very</p> <p>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every</p> <p>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle</p> <p>again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the</p> <p>stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long</p> <p>way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat</p> <p>down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its</p> <p>mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p> <p></p> <p> This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;</p> <p>so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out</p> <p>of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the</p> <p>distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she</p> <p>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself</p> <p>with one of the leaves: `I should have liked teaching it tricks</p> <p>very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh</p> <p>dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let</p> <p>me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or</p> <p>drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'</p> <p></p> <p> The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round</p> <p>her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see</p> <p>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under</p> <p>the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,</p> <p>about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under</p> <p>it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her</p> <p>that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.</p> <p></p> <p> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of</p> <p>the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large</p> <p>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,</p> <p>quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice</p> <p>of her or of anything else.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER V</p> <p></p> <p> Advice from a Caterpillar</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in</p> <p>silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice</p> <p>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--</p> <p>at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think</p> <p>I must have been changed several times since then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</p> <p>`Explain yourself!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because</p> <p>I'm not myself, you see.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very</p> <p>politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and</p> <p>being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but</p> <p>when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you</p> <p>know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll</p> <p>feel it a little queer, won't you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;</p> <p>`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. `Who are YOU?'</p> <p></p> <p> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the</p> <p>conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's</p> <p>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,</p> <p>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not</p> <p>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in</p> <p>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. `I've something</p> <p>important to say!'</p> <p></p> <p> This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as</p> <p>she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else</p> <p>to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth</p> <p>hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but</p> <p>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth</p> <p>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as</p> <p>I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it</p> <p>all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice folded her hands, and began:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,</p> <p> `And your hair has become very white;</p> <p> And yet you incessantly stand on your head--</p> <p> Do you think, at your age, it is right?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,</p> <p> `I feared it might injure the brain;</p> <p> But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,</p> <p> Why, I do it again and again.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,</p> <p> And have grown most uncommonly fat;</p> <p> Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--</p> <p> Pray, what is the reason of that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</p> <p> `I kept all my limbs very supple</p> <p> By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--</p> <p> Allow me to sell you a couple?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak</p> <p> For anything tougher than suet;</p> <p> Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--</p> <p> Pray how did you manage to do it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,</p> <p> And argued each case with my wife;</p> <p> And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,</p> <p> Has lasted the rest of my life.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose</p> <p> That your eye was as steady as ever;</p> <p> Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--</p> <p> What made you so awfully clever?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'</p> <p> Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!</p> <p> Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?</p> <p> Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the</p> <p>words have got altered.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.</p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar was the first to speak.</p> <p></p> <p> `What size do you want to be?' it asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;</p> <p>`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in</p> <p>her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you</p> <p>wouldn't mind,' said Alice: `three inches is such a wretched</p> <p>height to be.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three</p> <p>inches high).</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</p> <p>And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so</p> <p>easily offended!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it</p> <p>put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</p> <p></p> <p> This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</p> <p>In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got</p> <p>down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely</p> <p>remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and</p> <p>the other side will make you grow shorter.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had</p> <p>asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a</p> <p>minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as</p> <p>it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</p> <p>However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they</p> <p>would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p> <p></p> <p> `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a</p> <p>little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment</p> <p>she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her</p> <p>foot!</p> <p></p> <p> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but</p> <p>she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking</p> <p>rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.</p> <p>Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was</p> <p>hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and</p> <p>managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of</p> <p>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she</p> <p>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could</p> <p>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which</p> <p>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay</p> <p>far below her.</p> <p></p> <p> `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. `And where</p> <p>HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I</p> <p>can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no</p> <p>result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the</p> <p>distant green leaves.</p> <p></p> <p> As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her</p> <p>head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted</p> <p>to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,</p> <p>like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a</p> <p>graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which</p> <p>she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she</p> <p>had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a</p> <p>hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating</p> <p>her violently with its wings.</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. `Let me alone!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more</p> <p>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every</p> <p>way, and nothing seems to suit them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've</p> <p>tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but</p> <p>those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no</p> <p>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</p> <p></p> <p> `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the</p> <p>Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and</p> <p>day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was</p> <p>beginning to see its meaning.</p> <p></p> <p> `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued</p> <p>the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was</p> <p>thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come</p> <p>wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. `I'm a--I'm</p> <p>a--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're</p> <p>trying to invent something!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she</p> <p>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the</p> <p>deepest contempt. `I've seen a good many little girls in my</p> <p>time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a</p> <p>serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be</p> <p>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very</p> <p>truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as</p> <p>serpents do, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why</p> <p>then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent</p> <p>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of</p> <p>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and</p> <p>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a</p> <p>serpent?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm</p> <p>not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't</p> <p>want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it</p> <p>settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the</p> <p>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled</p> <p>among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and</p> <p>untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the</p> <p>pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very</p> <p>carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and</p> <p>growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had</p> <p>succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p> <p></p> <p> It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,</p> <p>that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a</p> <p>few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come,</p> <p>there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes</p> <p>are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to</p> <p>another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next</p> <p>thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be</p> <p>done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an</p> <p>open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</p> <p>`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come</p> <p>upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their</p> <p>wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did</p> <p>not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself</p> <p>down to nine inches high.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VI</p> <p></p> <p> Pig and Pepper</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and</p> <p>wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came</p> <p>running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman</p> <p>because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only,</p> <p>she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door</p> <p>with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,</p> <p>with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,</p> <p>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their</p> <p>heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and</p> <p>crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great</p> <p>letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to</p> <p>the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess. An</p> <p>invitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman</p> <p>repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the</p> <p>words a little, `From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess</p> <p>to play croquet.'</p> <p></p> <p> Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled</p> <p>together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into</p> <p>the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped</p> <p>out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the</p> <p>ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and</p> <p>that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the</p> <p>door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise</p> <p>inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was</p> <p>a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling</p> <p>and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish</p> <p>or kettle had been broken to pieces.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'</p> <p></p> <p> `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went</p> <p>on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us. For</p> <p>instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let</p> <p>you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time</p> <p>he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. `But</p> <p>perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so</p> <p>VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might</p> <p>answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate</p> <p>came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just</p> <p>grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees</p> <p>behind him.</p> <p></p> <p> `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,</p> <p>exactly as if nothing had happened.</p> <p></p> <p> `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. `That's the</p> <p>first question, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.</p> <p>`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the</p> <p>creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for</p> <p>repeating his remark, with variations. `I shall sit here,' he</p> <p>said, `on and off, for days and days.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what am I to do?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:</p> <p>`he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.</p> <p></p> <p> The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of</p> <p>smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a</p> <p>three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was</p> <p>leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to</p> <p>be full of soup.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to</p> <p>herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p> <p></p> <p> There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the</p> <p>Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was</p> <p>sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The</p> <p>only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,</p> <p>and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from</p> <p>ear to ear.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for</p> <p>she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to</p> <p>speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!'</p> <p></p> <p> She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice</p> <p>quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed</p> <p>to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I</p> <p>didn't know that cats COULD grin.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,</p> <p>feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</p> <p></p> <p> `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought</p> <p>it would be as well to introduce some other subject of</p> <p>conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took</p> <p>the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work</p> <p>throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby</p> <p>--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,</p> <p>plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when</p> <p>they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it</p> <p>was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up</p> <p>and down in an agony of terror. `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS</p> <p>nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very</p> <p>nearly carried it off.</p> <p></p> <p> `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a</p> <p>hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it</p> <p>does.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very</p> <p>glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her</p> <p>knowledge. `Just think of what work it would make with the day</p> <p>and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn</p> <p>round on its axis--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant</p> <p>to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and</p> <p>seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: `Twenty-four</p> <p>hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide</p> <p>figures!' And with that she began nursing her child again,</p> <p>singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a</p> <p>violent shake at the end of every line:</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak roughly to your little boy,</p> <p> And beat him when he sneezes:</p> <p> He only does it to annoy,</p> <p> Because he knows it teases.'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> (In which the cook and the baby joined):--</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept</p> <p>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing</p> <p>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I speak severely to my boy,</p> <p> I beat him when he sneezes;</p> <p> For he can thoroughly enjoy</p> <p> The pepper when he pleases!'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said</p> <p>to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. `I must go and</p> <p>get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of</p> <p>the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,</p> <p>but it just missed her.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-</p> <p>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all</p> <p>directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor</p> <p>little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,</p> <p>and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,</p> <p>so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much</p> <p>as she could do to hold it.</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,</p> <p>(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep</p> <p>tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its</p> <p>undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. `IF I</p> <p>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure</p> <p>to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it</p> <p>behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing</p> <p>grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). `Don't</p> <p>grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing</p> <p>yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into</p> <p>its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no</p> <p>doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout</p> <p>than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for</p> <p>a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at</p> <p>all. `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked</p> <p>into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</p> <p></p> <p> No, there were no tears. `If you're going to turn into a pig,</p> <p>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do</p> <p>with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or</p> <p>grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for</p> <p>some while in silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I</p> <p>to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted</p> <p>again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some</p> <p>alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was</p> <p>neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be</p> <p>quite absurd for her to carry it further.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to</p> <p>see it trot away quietly into the wood. `If it had grown up,'</p> <p>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:</p> <p>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began</p> <p>thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as</p> <p>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right</p> <p>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing</p> <p>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-</p> <p>natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great</p> <p>many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p> <p></p> <p> `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at</p> <p>all know whether it would like the name: however, it only</p> <p>grinned a little wider. `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought</p> <p>Alice, and she went on. `Would you tell me, please, which way I</p> <p>ought to go from here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said</p> <p>the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't much care where--' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk</p> <p>long enough.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another</p> <p>question. `What sort of people live about here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,</p> <p>`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,</p> <p>`lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.</p> <p>I'm mad. You're mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on</p> <p>`And how do you know that you're mad?'</p> <p></p> <p> `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad. You grant</p> <p>that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I suppose so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's</p> <p>angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm</p> <p>pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call it what you like,' said the Cat. `Do you play croquet</p> <p>with the Queen to-day?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been</p> <p>invited yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used</p> <p>to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place</p> <p>where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.</p> <p></p> <p> `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. `I'd</p> <p>nearly forgotten to ask.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had</p> <p>come back in a natural way.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it</p> <p>did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the</p> <p>direction in which the March Hare was said to live. `I've seen</p> <p>hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be</p> <p>much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be</p> <p>raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.' As she said</p> <p>this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a</p> <p>branch of a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep</p> <p>appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'</p> <p></p> <p> `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,</p> <p>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,</p> <p>which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever</p> <p>saw in my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the</p> <p>house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house,</p> <p>because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was</p> <p>thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not</p> <p>like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand</p> <p>bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even</p> <p>then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself</p> <p>`Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd</p> <p>gone to see the Hatter instead!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VII</p> <p></p> <p> A Mad Tea-Party</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,</p> <p>and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a</p> <p>Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two</p> <p>were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking</p> <p>over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p> <p></p> <p> The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded</p> <p>together at one corner of it: `No room! No room!' they cried</p> <p>out when they saw Alice coming. `There's PLENTY of room!' said</p> <p>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one</p> <p>end of the table.</p> <p></p> <p> `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it</p> <p>but tea. `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice</p> <p>angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being</p> <p>invited,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a</p> <p>great many more than three.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been</p> <p>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was</p> <p>his first speech.</p> <p></p> <p> `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said</p> <p>with some severity; `it's very rude.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all</p> <p>he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. `I'm glad</p> <p>they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she</p> <p>added aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'</p> <p>said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what</p> <p>I say--that's the same thing, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. `You might just</p> <p>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat</p> <p>what I see"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I</p> <p>like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to</p> <p>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the</p> <p>same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the</p> <p>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,</p> <p>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and</p> <p>writing-desks, which wasn't much.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter was the first to break the silence. `What day of</p> <p>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his</p> <p>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking</p> <p>it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. `I told you butter</p> <p>wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March</p> <p>Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter</p> <p>grumbled: `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'</p> <p></p> <p> The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then</p> <p>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he</p> <p>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It</p> <p>was the BEST butter, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</p> <p>`What a funny watch!' she remarked. `It tells the day of the</p> <p>month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. `Does YOUR watch tell</p> <p>you what year it is?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: `but that's</p> <p>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to</p> <p>have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</p> <p>`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she</p> <p>could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured</p> <p>a little hot tea upon its nose.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without</p> <p>opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to</p> <p>remark myself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to</p> <p>Alice again.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I give it up,' Alice replied: `what's the answer?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nor I,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice sighed wearily. `I think you might do something better</p> <p>with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that</p> <p>have no answers.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you</p> <p>wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head</p> <p>contemptuously. `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: `but I know I have to</p> <p>beat time when I learn music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. `He won't stand</p> <p>beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do</p> <p>almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose</p> <p>it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:</p> <p>you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the</p> <p>clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'</p> <p></p> <p> (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a</p> <p>whisper.)</p> <p></p> <p> `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:</p> <p>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: `but you could keep</p> <p>it to half-past one as long as you liked.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter shook his head mournfully. `Not I!' he replied.</p> <p>`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'</p> <p>(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the</p> <p>great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing</p> <p></p> <p> "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</p> <p> How I wonder what you're at!"</p> <p></p> <p>You know the song, perhaps?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--</p> <p></p> <p> "Up above the world you fly,</p> <p> Like a tea-tray in the sky.</p> <p> Twinkle, twinkle--"'</p> <p></p> <p>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep</p> <p>`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that</p> <p>they had to pinch it to make it stop.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,</p> <p>`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the</p> <p>time! Off with his head!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,</p> <p>`he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'</p> <p></p> <p> A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so</p> <p>many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always</p> <p>tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice</p> <p>ventured to ask.</p> <p></p> <p> `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,</p> <p>yawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady</p> <p>tells us a story.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at</p> <p>the proposal.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. `Wake up,</p> <p>Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. `I wasn't asleep,' he</p> <p>said in a hoarse, feeble voice: `I heard every word you fellows</p> <p>were saying.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep</p> <p>again before it's done.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the</p> <p>Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,</p> <p>Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great</p> <p>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</p> <p></p> <p> `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a</p> <p>minute or two.</p> <p></p> <p> `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently</p> <p>remarked; `they'd have been ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways</p> <p>of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went</p> <p>on: `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very</p> <p>earnestly.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so</p> <p>I can't take more.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very</p> <p>easy to take MORE than nothing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked</p> <p>triumphantly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped</p> <p>herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the</p> <p>Dormouse, and repeated her question. `Why did they live at the</p> <p>bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and</p> <p>then said, `It was a treacle-well.'</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but</p> <p>the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse</p> <p>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the</p> <p>story for yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt</p> <p>again. I dare say there may be ONE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he</p> <p>consented to go on. `And so these three little sisters--they</p> <p>were learning to draw, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this</p> <p>time.</p> <p></p> <p> `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: `let's all move</p> <p>one place on.'</p> <p></p> <p> He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the</p> <p>March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather</p> <p>unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the</p> <p>only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a</p> <p>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset</p> <p>the milk-jug into his plate.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began</p> <p>very cautiously: `But I don't understand. Where did they draw</p> <p>the treacle from?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so</p> <p>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,</p> <p>stupid?'</p> <p></p> <p> `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not</p> <p>choosing to notice this last remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'</p> <p></p> <p> This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse</p> <p>go on for some time without interrupting it.</p> <p></p> <p> `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and</p> <p>rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew</p> <p>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why with an M?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why not?' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going</p> <p>off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up</p> <p>again with a little shriek, and went on: `--that begins with an</p> <p>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--</p> <p>you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever</p> <p>see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I</p> <p>don't think--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got</p> <p>up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep</p> <p>instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her</p> <p>going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that</p> <p>they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were</p> <p>trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</p> <p></p> <p> `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she</p> <p>picked her way through the wood. `It's the stupidest tea-party I</p> <p>ever was at in all my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a</p> <p>door leading right into it. `That's very curious!' she thought.</p> <p>`But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.'</p> <p>And in she went.</p> <p></p> <p> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the</p> <p>little glass table. `Now, I'll manage better this time,'</p> <p>she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,</p> <p>and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went</p> <p>to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it</p> <p>in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down</p> <p>the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the</p> <p>beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VIII</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's Croquet-Ground</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the</p> <p>roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at</p> <p>it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious</p> <p>thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up</p> <p>to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go</p> <p>splashing paint over me like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged</p> <p>my elbow.'</p> <p></p> <p> On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always</p> <p>lay the blame on others!'</p> <p></p> <p> `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. `I heard the Queen say only</p> <p>yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it</p> <p>was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'</p> <p></p> <p> Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all</p> <p>the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as</p> <p>she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the</p> <p>others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are</p> <p>painting those roses?'</p> <p></p> <p> Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a</p> <p>low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to</p> <p>have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;</p> <p>and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads</p> <p>cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore</p> <p>she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously</p> <p>looking across the garden, called out `The Queen! The Queen!'</p> <p>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon</p> <p>their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice</p> <p>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped</p> <p>like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and</p> <p>feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were</p> <p>ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the</p> <p>soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were</p> <p>ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand</p> <p>in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next</p> <p>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice</p> <p>recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous</p> <p>manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without</p> <p>noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the</p> <p>King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this</p> <p>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on</p> <p>her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember</p> <p>ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,</p> <p>what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people</p> <p>had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'</p> <p>So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p> <p></p> <p> When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped</p> <p>and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'</p> <p>She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,</p> <p>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'</p> <p></p> <p> `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very</p> <p>politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of</p> <p>cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three</p> <p>gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as</p> <p>they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs</p> <p>was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether</p> <p>they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her</p> <p>own children.</p> <p></p> <p> `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</p> <p>`It's no business of MINE.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her</p> <p>for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!</p> <p>Off--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the</p> <p>Queen was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said</p> <p>`Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave</p> <p>`Turn them over!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p> <p></p> <p> `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the</p> <p>three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the</p> <p>King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</p> <p></p> <p> `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. `You make me giddy.'</p> <p>And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you</p> <p>been doing here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,</p> <p>going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the</p> <p>roses. `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,</p> <p>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate</p> <p>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</p> <p></p> <p> `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a</p> <p>large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered</p> <p>about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly</p> <p>marched off after the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers</p> <p>shouted in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's right!' shouted the Queen. `Can you play croquet?'</p> <p></p> <p> The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question</p> <p>was evidently meant for her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes!' shouted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the</p> <p>procession, wondering very much what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.</p> <p>She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously</p> <p>into her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very,' said Alice: `--where's the Duchess?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He</p> <p>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised</p> <p>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and</p> <p>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I didn't,' said Alice: `I don't think it's at all a pity.</p> <p>I said "What for?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a</p> <p>little scream of laughter. `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a</p> <p>frightened tone. `The Queen will hear you! You see, she came</p> <p>rather late, and the Queen said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,</p> <p>and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up</p> <p>against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or</p> <p>two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a</p> <p>curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and</p> <p>furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live</p> <p>flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to</p> <p>stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p> <p></p> <p> The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her</p> <p>flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,</p> <p>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,</p> <p>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened</p> <p>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it</p> <p>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a</p> <p>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:</p> <p>and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,</p> <p>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled</p> <p>itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,</p> <p>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she</p> <p>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers</p> <p>were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the</p> <p>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very</p> <p>difficult game indeed.</p> <p></p> <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns,</p> <p>quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in</p> <p>a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went</p> <p>stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with</p> <p>her head!' about once in a minute.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as</p> <p>yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might</p> <p>happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of</p> <p>me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great</p> <p>wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'</p> <p></p> <p> She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering</p> <p>whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a</p> <p>curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at</p> <p>first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to</p> <p>be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat: now I</p> <p>shall have somebody to talk to.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was</p> <p>mouth enough for it to speak with.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. `It's no</p> <p>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at</p> <p>least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared,</p> <p>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the</p> <p>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The</p> <p>Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and</p> <p>no more of it appeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather</p> <p>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't</p> <p>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in</p> <p>particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and</p> <p>you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;</p> <p>for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next</p> <p>walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have</p> <p>croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it</p> <p>saw mine coming!'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at all,' said Alice: `she's so extremely--' Just then</p> <p>she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so</p> <p>she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while</p> <p>finishing the game.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen smiled and passed on.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and</p> <p>looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: `allow me</p> <p>to introduce it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:</p> <p>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me</p> <p>like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. `I've read that in</p> <p>some book, but I don't remember where.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and</p> <p>he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear! I</p> <p>wish you would have this cat removed!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great</p> <p>or small. `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking</p> <p>round.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and</p> <p>he hurried off.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game</p> <p>was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,</p> <p>screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three</p> <p>of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and</p> <p>she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in</p> <p>such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or</p> <p>not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p> <p></p> <p> The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,</p> <p>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one</p> <p>of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her</p> <p>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where</p> <p>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up</p> <p>into a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,</p> <p>the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:</p> <p>`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches</p> <p>are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away</p> <p>under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for</p> <p>a little more conversation with her friend.</p> <p></p> <p> When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to</p> <p>find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute</p> <p>going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who</p> <p>were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,</p> <p>and looked very uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to</p> <p>settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,</p> <p>though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed</p> <p>to make out exactly what they said.</p> <p></p> <p> The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a</p> <p>head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had</p> <p>never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin</p> <p>at HIS time of life.</p> <p></p> <p> The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be</p> <p>beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about</p> <p>it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.</p> <p>(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so</p> <p>grave and anxious.)</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the</p> <p>Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: `fetch</p> <p>her here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,</p> <p>by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely</p> <p>disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down</p> <p>looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IX</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle's Story</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old</p> <p>thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately</p> <p>into Alice's, and they walked off together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and</p> <p>thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had</p> <p>made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p> `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very</p> <p>hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT</p> <p>ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that</p> <p>makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at</p> <p>having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them</p> <p>sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar</p> <p>and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish</p> <p>people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you</p> <p>know--'</p> <p></p> <p> She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a</p> <p>little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</p> <p>`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you</p> <p>forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that</p> <p>is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. `Everything's got a</p> <p>moral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up</p> <p>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first,</p> <p>because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was</p> <p>exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,</p> <p>and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not</p> <p>like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of</p> <p>keeping up the conversation a little.</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis so,' said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--"Oh,</p> <p>'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody</p> <p>minding their own business!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,</p> <p>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,</p> <p>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the</p> <p>sounds will take care of themselves."'</p> <p></p> <p> `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your</p> <p>waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I'm</p> <p>doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the</p> <p>experiment?'</p> <p></p> <p> `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all</p> <p>anxious to have the experiment tried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very true,' said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both</p> <p>bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock</p> <p>together."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: `what a clear way you</p> <p>have of putting things!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree</p> <p>to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near</p> <p>here. And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the</p> <p>less there is of yours."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this</p> <p>last remark, `it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it</p> <p>is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of</p> <p>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put</p> <p>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than</p> <p>what it might appear to others that what you were or might have</p> <p>been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared</p> <p>to them to be otherwise."'</p> <p></p> <p> `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very</p> <p>politely, `if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it</p> <p>as you say it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess</p> <p>replied, in a pleased tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'</p> <p>said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. `I make you</p> <p>a present of everything I've said as yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. `I'm glad they don't</p> <p>give birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to</p> <p>say it out loud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her</p> <p>sharp little chin.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was</p> <p>beginning to feel a little worried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;</p> <p>and the m--'</p> <p></p> <p> But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died</p> <p>away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the</p> <p>arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up,</p> <p>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,</p> <p>frowning like a thunderstorm.</p> <p></p> <p> `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on</p> <p>the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,</p> <p>and that in about half no time! Take your choice!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p> <p></p> <p> `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice</p> <p>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her</p> <p>back to the croquet-ground.</p> <p></p> <p> The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,</p> <p>and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her,</p> <p>they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a</p> <p>moment's delay would cost them their lives.</p> <p></p> <p> All the time they were playing the Queen never left off</p> <p>quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his</p> <p>head!' or `Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were</p> <p>taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave</p> <p>off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour</p> <p>or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the</p> <p>King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of</p> <p>execution.</p> <p></p> <p> Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to</p> <p>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said Alice. `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his</p> <p>history,'</p> <p></p> <p> As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low</p> <p>voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.' `Come,</p> <p>THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite</p> <p>unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p> <p></p> <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the</p> <p>sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)</p> <p>`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to</p> <p>see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and</p> <p>see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,</p> <p>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like</p> <p>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would</p> <p>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage</p> <p>Queen: so she waited.</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the</p> <p>Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!'</p> <p>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the fun?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. `It's all her fancy, that: they</p> <p>never executes nobody, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went</p> <p>slowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life,</p> <p>never!'</p> <p></p> <p> They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the</p> <p>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,</p> <p>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart</p> <p>would break. She pitied him deeply. `What is his sorrow?' she</p> <p>asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the</p> <p>same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got</p> <p>no sorrow, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with</p> <p>large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to</p> <p>know your history, she do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow</p> <p>tone: `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've</p> <p>finished.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice</p> <p>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he</p> <p>doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.</p> <p></p> <p> `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was</p> <p>a real Turtle.'</p> <p></p> <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only</p> <p>by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and</p> <p>the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very</p> <p>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your</p> <p>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be</p> <p>more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more</p> <p>calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to</p> <p>school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call</p> <p>him Tortoise--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle angrily: `really you are very dull!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple</p> <p>question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and</p> <p>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At</p> <p>last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!</p> <p>Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe</p> <p>it--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak</p> <p>again. The Mock Turtle went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school</p> <p>every day--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be</p> <p>so proud as all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle in a tone of great relief. `Now at OURS they had at the</p> <p>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'</p> <p></p> <p> `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the</p> <p>bottom of the sea.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a</p> <p>sigh. `I only took the regular course.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was that?' inquired Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock</p> <p>Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--</p> <p>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. `What is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. `What! Never</p> <p>heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. `You know what to beautify is,</p> <p>I suppose?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to</p> <p>uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about</p> <p>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you</p> <p>to learn?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting</p> <p>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,</p> <p>with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old</p> <p>conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us</p> <p>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was THAT like?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: `I'm</p> <p>too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics</p> <p>master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he</p> <p>taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;</p> <p>and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a</p> <p>hurry to change the subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the</p> <p>next, and so on.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon</p> <p>remarked: `because they lessen from day to day.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a</p> <p>little before she made her next remark. `Then the eleventh day</p> <p>must have been a holiday?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a</p> <p>very decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER X</p> <p></p> <p> The Lobster Quadrille</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper</p> <p>across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for</p> <p>a minute or two sobs choked his voice. `Same as if he had a bone</p> <p>in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him</p> <p>and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered</p> <p>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--</p> <p>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'</p> <p>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,</p> <p>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful</p> <p>thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, indeed,' said Alice. `What sort of a dance is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;</p> <p>then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `--you advance twice--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: `advance twice, set to</p> <p>partners--'</p> <p></p> <p> `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the</p> <p>Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</p> <p></p> <p> `--as far out to sea as you can--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,</p> <p>capering wildly about.</p> <p></p> <p> `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the</p> <p>Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,</p> <p>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat</p> <p>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very much indeed,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the</p> <p>Gryphon. `We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall</p> <p>sing?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. `I've forgotten the words.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now</p> <p>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and</p> <p>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle</p> <p>sang this, very slowly and sadly:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>`"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.</p> <p>"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my</p> <p> tail.</p> <p>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</p> <p>They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be</p> <p>When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to</p> <p> sea!"</p> <p>But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look</p> <p> askance--</p> <p>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the</p> <p> dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p></p> <p>`"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.</p> <p>"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.</p> <p>The further off from England the nearer is to France--</p> <p>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</p> <p></p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p> dance?</p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p> dance?"'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said</p> <p>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: `and I do so</p> <p>like that curious song about the whiting!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've</p> <p>seen them, of course?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she</p> <p>checked herself hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but</p> <p>if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're</p> <p>like.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. `They have their</p> <p>tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:</p> <p>`crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails</p> <p>in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle</p> <p>yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all</p> <p>that,' he said to the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with</p> <p>the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So</p> <p>they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in</p> <p>their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting. I never knew</p> <p>so much about a whiting before.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the</p> <p>Gryphon. `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never thought about it,' said Alice. `Why?'</p> <p></p> <p> `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very</p> <p>solemnly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was thoroughly puzzled. `Does the boots and shoes!' she</p> <p>repeated in a wondering tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. `I</p> <p>mean, what makes them so shiny?'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she</p> <p>gave her answer. `They're done with blacking, I believe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep</p> <p>voice, `are done with a whiting. Now you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great</p> <p>curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather</p> <p>impatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were</p> <p>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep</p> <p>back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>said: `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came</p> <p>to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With</p> <p>what porpoise?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended</p> <p>tone. And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR</p> <p>adventures.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'</p> <p>said Alice a little timidly: `but it's no use going back to</p> <p>yesterday, because I was a different person then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an</p> <p>impatient tone: `explanations take such a dreadful time.'</p> <p></p> <p> So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when</p> <p>she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about</p> <p>it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on</p> <p>each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she</p> <p>gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly</p> <p>quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,</p> <p>FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming</p> <p>different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said</p> <p>`That's very curious.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated</p> <p>thoughtfully. `I should like to hear her try and repeat</p> <p>something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as</p> <p>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said</p> <p>the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat</p> <p>lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'</p> <p>However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so</p> <p>full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was</p> <p>saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,</p> <p> "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."</p> <p> As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose</p> <p> Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,</p> <p> And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,</p> <p> But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,</p> <p> His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]</p> <p></p> <p> `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'</p> <p>said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it</p> <p>sounds uncommon nonsense.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her</p> <p>hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. `Go on with</p> <p>the next verse.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. `How COULD</p> <p>he turn them out with his nose, you know?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was</p> <p>dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the</p> <p>subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:</p> <p>`it begins "I passed by his garden."'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would</p> <p>all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,</p> <p> How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,</p> <p> While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</p> <p> When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,</p> <p> Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:</p> <p> While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,</p> <p> And concluded the banquet--]</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far</p> <p>the most confusing thing I ever heard!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and</p> <p>Alice was only too glad to do so.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the</p> <p>Gryphon went on. `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you</p> <p>a song?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'</p> <p>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather</p> <p>offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her</p> <p>"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes</p> <p>choked with sobs, to sing this:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</p> <p> Waiting in a hot tureen!</p> <p> Who for such dainties would not stoop?</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,</p> <p> Game, or any other dish?</p> <p> Who would not give all else for two</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had</p> <p>just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'</p> <p>was heard in the distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,</p> <p>it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</p> <p></p> <p> `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon</p> <p>only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more</p> <p>faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the</p> <p>melancholy words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XI</p> <p></p> <p> Who Stole the Tarts?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when</p> <p>they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts</p> <p>of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:</p> <p>the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on</p> <p>each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,</p> <p>with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the</p> <p>other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large</p> <p>dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice</p> <p>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'</p> <p>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed</p> <p>to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about</p> <p>her, to pass away the time.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had</p> <p>read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that</p> <p>she knew the name of nearly everything there. `That's the</p> <p>judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'</p> <p></p> <p> The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown</p> <p>over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he</p> <p>did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly</p> <p>not becoming.</p> <p></p> <p> `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve</p> <p>creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because</p> <p>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they</p> <p>are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over</p> <p>to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and</p> <p>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the</p> <p>meaning of it at all. However, `jury-men' would have done just</p> <p>as well.</p> <p></p> <p> The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</p> <p>`What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. `They</p> <p>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in</p> <p>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the</p> <p>trial.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but</p> <p>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in</p> <p>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked</p> <p>anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their</p> <p>shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'</p> <p>on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them</p> <p>didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his</p> <p>neighbour to tell him. `A nice muddle their slates'll be in</p> <p>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,</p> <p>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got</p> <p>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it</p> <p>away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was</p> <p>Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of</p> <p>it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write</p> <p>with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very</p> <p>little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p> <p></p> <p> `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and</p> <p>then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--</p> <p></p> <p> `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,</p> <p> All on a summer day:</p> <p> The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,</p> <p> And took them quite away!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. `There's</p> <p>a great deal to come before that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit</p> <p>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First</p> <p>witness!'</p> <p></p> <p> The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in</p> <p>one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. `I beg</p> <p>pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in: but I</p> <p>hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to have finished,' said the King. `When did you</p> <p>begin?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into</p> <p>the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. `Fourteenth of March, I</p> <p>think it was,' he said.</p> <p></p> <p> `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury</p> <p>eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then</p> <p>added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</p> <p></p> <p> `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who</p> <p>instantly made a memorandum of the fact.</p> <p></p> <p> `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;</p> <p>`I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'</p> <p></p> <p> Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or</p> <p>I'll have you executed on the spot.'</p> <p></p> <p> This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept</p> <p>shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the</p> <p>Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his</p> <p>teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.</p> <p></p> <p> Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which</p> <p>puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was</p> <p>beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she</p> <p>would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she</p> <p>decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for</p> <p>her.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was</p> <p>sitting next to her. `I can hardly breathe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: `I'm growing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: `you know</p> <p>you're growing too.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:</p> <p>`not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily</p> <p>and crossed over to the other side of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to</p> <p>one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the</p> <p>singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter</p> <p>trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have</p> <p>you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a</p> <p>trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week</p> <p>or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and</p> <p>the twinkling of the tea--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.</p> <p>`Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things</p> <p>twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did!' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `I deny it!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `He denies it,' said the King: `leave out that part.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,</p> <p>looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the</p> <p>Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</p> <p></p> <p> `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-</p> <p>and-butter--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you</p> <p>executed.'</p> <p></p> <p> The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,</p> <p>and went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he</p> <p>began.</p> <p></p> <p> `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately</p> <p>suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a</p> <p>hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had</p> <p>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:</p> <p>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat</p> <p>upon it.)</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've so often</p> <p>read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some</p> <p>attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the</p> <p>officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant</p> <p>till now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'</p> <p>continued the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as</p> <p>it is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.</p> <p></p> <p> Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. `Now we</p> <p>shall get on better.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious</p> <p>look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</p> <p></p> <p> `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the</p> <p>court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.</p> <p></p> <p> `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one</p> <p>of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the</p> <p>officer could get to the door.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the next witness!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the</p> <p>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before</p> <p>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began</p> <p>sneezing all at once.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shan't,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a</p> <p>low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy</p> <p>air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till</p> <p>his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What</p> <p>are tarts made of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead that</p> <p>Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch</p> <p>him! Off with his whiskers!'</p> <p></p> <p> For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the</p> <p>Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down</p> <p>again, the cook had disappeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.</p> <p>`Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the</p> <p>Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.</p> <p>It quite makes my forehead ache!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,</p> <p>feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,</p> <p>`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.</p> <p>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top</p> <p>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XII</p> <p></p> <p> Alice's Evidence</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the</p> <p>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she</p> <p>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with</p> <p>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads</p> <p>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding</p> <p>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset</p> <p>the week before.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great</p> <p>dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,</p> <p>for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and</p> <p>she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once</p> <p>and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</p> <p></p> <p> `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave</p> <p>voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--</p> <p>ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as</p> <p>he said do.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she</p> <p>had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing</p> <p>was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable</p> <p>to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that</p> <p>it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it</p> <p>would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of</p> <p>being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and</p> <p>handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write</p> <p>out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed</p> <p>too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,</p> <p>gazing up into the roof of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you know about this business?' the King said to</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.</p> <p>They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when</p> <p>the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,</p> <p>of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and</p> <p>making faces at him as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and</p> <p>went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--</p> <p>unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word</p> <p>sounded best.</p> <p></p> <p> Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some</p> <p>`unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to</p> <p>look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she</p> <p>thought to herself.</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily</p> <p>writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out</p> <p>from his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE</p> <p>HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'</p> <p></p> <p> Everybody looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You are,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides,</p> <p>that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</p> <p>`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said</p> <p>the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has</p> <p>just been picked up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What's in it?' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems</p> <p>to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was</p> <p>written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,</p> <p>there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper</p> <p>as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set</p> <p>of verses.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of</p> <p>the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the</p> <p>queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)</p> <p></p> <p> `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.</p> <p>(The jury all brightened up again.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and</p> <p>they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the</p> <p>matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd</p> <p>have signed your name like an honest man.'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the</p> <p>first really clever thing the King had said that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't</p> <p>even know what they're about!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Read them,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,</p> <p>please your Majesty?' he asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on</p> <p>till you come to the end: then stop.'</p> <p></p> <p> These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--</p> <p></p> <p> `They told me you had been to her,</p> <p> And mentioned me to him:</p> <p> She gave me a good character,</p> <p> But said I could not swim.</p> <p></p> <p> He sent them word I had not gone</p> <p> (We know it to be true):</p> <p> If she should push the matter on,</p> <p> What would become of you?</p> <p></p> <p> I gave her one, they gave him two,</p> <p> You gave us three or more;</p> <p> They all returned from him to you,</p> <p> Though they were mine before.</p> <p></p> <p> If I or she should chance to be</p> <p> Involved in this affair,</p> <p> He trusts to you to set them free,</p> <p> Exactly as we were.</p> <p></p> <p> My notion was that you had been</p> <p> (Before she had this fit)</p> <p> An obstacle that came between</p> <p> Him, and ourselves, and it.</p> <p></p> <p> Don't let him know she liked them best,</p> <p> For this must ever be</p> <p> A secret, kept from all the rest,</p> <p> Between yourself and me.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'</p> <p>said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'</p> <p></p> <p> `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had</p> <p>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit</p> <p>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't</p> <p>believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'</p> <p></p> <p> The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe</p> <p>there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to</p> <p>explain the paper.</p> <p></p> <p> `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a</p> <p>world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And</p> <p>yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his</p> <p>knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some</p> <p>meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you</p> <p>can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.</p> <p>(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)</p> <p></p> <p> `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering</p> <p>over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's</p> <p>the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,</p> <p>that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to</p> <p>the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.</p> <p>Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my</p> <p>dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the</p> <p>Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off</p> <p>writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no</p> <p>mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was</p> <p>trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round</p> <p>the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and</p> <p>everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the</p> <p>King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having</p> <p>the sentence first!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't!' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</p> <p>Nobody moved.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full</p> <p>size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'</p> <p></p> <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying</p> <p>down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half</p> <p>of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on</p> <p>the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently</p> <p>brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the</p> <p>trees upon her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long</p> <p>sleep you've had!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told</p> <p>her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange</p> <p>Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and</p> <p>when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a</p> <p>curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's</p> <p>getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she</p> <p>ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</p> <p></p> <p> But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her</p> <p>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of</p> <p>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began</p> <p>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--</p> <p></p> <p> First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the</p> <p>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes</p> <p>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her</p> <p>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back</p> <p>the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and</p> <p>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place</p> <p>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little</p> <p>sister's dream.</p> <p></p> <p> The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried</p> <p>by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the</p> <p>neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as</p> <p>the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,</p> <p>and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate</p> <p>guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the</p> <p>Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once</p> <p>more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's</p> <p>slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,</p> <p>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable</p> <p>Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in</p> <p>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and</p> <p>all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only</p> <p>rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the</p> <p>reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-</p> <p>bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd</p> <p>boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and</p> <p>all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the</p> <p>confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the</p> <p>cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's</p> <p>heavy sobs.</p> <p></p> <p> Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of</p> <p>hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how</p> <p>she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and</p> <p>loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about</p> <p>her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager</p> <p>with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of</p> <p>Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their</p> <p>simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,</p> <p>remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</p> <p></p> <p> THE END</p>
ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND</p> <p></p> <p> Lewis Carroll</p> <p></p> <p> THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER I</p> <p></p> <p> Down the Rabbit-Hole</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister</p> <p>on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had</p> <p>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no</p> <p>pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'</p> <p>thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'</p> <p></p> <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,</p> <p>for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether</p> <p>the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble</p> <p>of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White</p> <p>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p> <p></p> <p> There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice</p> <p>think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to</p> <p>itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought</p> <p>it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have</p> <p>wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);</p> <p>but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-</p> <p>POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to</p> <p>her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never</p> <p>before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to</p> <p>take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the</p> <p>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop</p> <p>down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p> <p></p> <p> In another moment down went Alice after it, never once</p> <p>considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,</p> <p>and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a</p> <p>moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself</p> <p>falling down a very deep well.</p> <p></p> <p> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she</p> <p>had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to</p> <p>wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look</p> <p>down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to</p> <p>see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and</p> <p>noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;</p> <p>here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She</p> <p>took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was</p> <p>labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it</p> <p>was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing</p> <p>somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she</p> <p>fell past it.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I</p> <p>shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll</p> <p>all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,</p> <p>even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely</p> <p>true.)</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! `I</p> <p>wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.</p> <p>`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let</p> <p>me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,</p> <p>you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her</p> <p>lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good</p> <p>opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to</p> <p>listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,</p> <p>that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude</p> <p>or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,</p> <p>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to</p> <p>say.)</p> <p></p> <p> Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right</p> <p>THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the</p> <p>people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I</p> <p>think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this</p> <p>time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall</p> <p>have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.</p> <p>Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried</p> <p>to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling</p> <p>through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what</p> <p>an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll</p> <p>never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon</p> <p>began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I</p> <p>should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember</p> <p>her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were</p> <p>down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but</p> <p>you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.</p> <p>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get</p> <p>rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of</p> <p>way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do</p> <p>bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either</p> <p>question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt</p> <p>that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she</p> <p>was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very</p> <p>earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a</p> <p>bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of</p> <p>sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a</p> <p>moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her</p> <p>was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in</p> <p>sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:</p> <p>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it</p> <p>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late</p> <p>it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the</p> <p>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found</p> <p>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps</p> <p>hanging from the roof.</p> <p></p> <p> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;</p> <p>and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the</p> <p>other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,</p> <p>wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of</p> <p>solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,</p> <p>and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the</p> <p>doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or</p> <p>the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of</p> <p>them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low</p> <p>curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little</p> <p>door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key</p> <p>in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p> <p></p> <p> Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small</p> <p>passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and</p> <p>looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</p> <p>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about</p> <p>among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but</p> <p>she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if</p> <p>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of</p> <p>very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish</p> <p>I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only</p> <p>know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things</p> <p>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few</p> <p>things indeed were really impossible.</p> <p></p> <p> There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she</p> <p>went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on</p> <p>it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like</p> <p>telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which</p> <p>certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck</p> <p>of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'</p> <p>beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p> <p></p> <p> It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little</p> <p>Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look</p> <p>first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';</p> <p>for she had read several nice little histories about children who</p> <p>had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant</p> <p>things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules</p> <p>their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker</p> <p>will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your</p> <p>finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had</p> <p>never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked</p> <p>`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or</p> <p>later.</p> <p></p> <p> However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured</p> <p>to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort</p> <p>of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast</p> <p>turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished</p> <p>it off.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up</p> <p>like a telescope.'</p> <p></p> <p> And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and</p> <p>her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right</p> <p>size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.</p> <p>First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was</p> <p>going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about</p> <p>this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my</p> <p>going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be</p> <p>like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is</p> <p>like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember</p> <p>ever having seen such a thing.</p> <p></p> <p> After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided</p> <p>on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!</p> <p>when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the</p> <p>little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,</p> <p>she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it</p> <p>quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb</p> <p>up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;</p> <p>and when she had tired herself out with trying,</p> <p>the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to</p> <p>herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'</p> <p>She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very</p> <p>seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so</p> <p>severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered</p> <p>trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game</p> <p>of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious</p> <p>child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no</p> <p>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why,</p> <p>there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable</p> <p>person!'</p> <p></p> <p> Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under</p> <p>the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on</p> <p>which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.</p> <p>`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,</p> <p>I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep</p> <p>under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I</p> <p>don't care which happens!'</p> <p></p> <p> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which</p> <p>way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to</p> <p>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to</p> <p>find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally</p> <p>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the</p> <p>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,</p> <p>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the</p> <p>common way.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER II</p> <p></p> <p> The Pool of Tears</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much</p> <p>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good</p> <p>English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that</p> <p>ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her</p> <p>feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so</p> <p>far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on</p> <p>your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't</p> <p>be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself</p> <p>about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be</p> <p>kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the</p> <p>way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of</p> <p>boots every Christmas.'</p> <p></p> <p> And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.</p> <p>`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll</p> <p>seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the</p> <p>directions will look!</p> <p></p> <p> ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</p> <p> HEARTHRUG,</p> <p> NEAR THE FENDER,</p> <p> (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).</p> <p></p> <p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in</p> <p>fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took</p> <p>up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p> <p></p> <p> Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one</p> <p>side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get</p> <p>through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to</p> <p>cry again.</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great</p> <p>girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in</p> <p>this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all</p> <p>the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool</p> <p>all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the</p> <p>hall.</p> <p></p> <p> After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the</p> <p>distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p> <p>It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a</p> <p>pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the</p> <p>other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to</p> <p>himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she</p> <p>be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate</p> <p>that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit</p> <p>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,</p> <p>sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid</p> <p>gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard</p> <p>as he could go.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very</p> <p>hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:</p> <p>`Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday</p> <p>things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in</p> <p>the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this</p> <p>morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little</p> <p>different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in</p> <p>the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began</p> <p>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age</p> <p>as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of</p> <p>them.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such</p> <p>long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm</p> <p>sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,</p> <p>oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,</p> <p>and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the</p> <p>things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,</p> <p>and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!</p> <p>I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the</p> <p>Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.</p> <p>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,</p> <p>and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been</p> <p>changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'</p> <p>and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,</p> <p>and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and</p> <p>strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--</p> <p></p> <p> `How doth the little crocodile</p> <p> Improve his shining tail,</p> <p> And pour the waters of the Nile</p> <p> On every golden scale!</p> <p></p> <p> `How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p> <p> How neatly spread his claws,</p> <p> And welcome little fishes in</p> <p> With gently smiling jaws!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and</p> <p>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel</p> <p>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little</p> <p>house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so</p> <p>many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm</p> <p>Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their</p> <p>heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look</p> <p>up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I</p> <p>like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down</p> <p>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a</p> <p>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads</p> <p>down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was</p> <p>surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little</p> <p>white kid gloves while she was talking. `How CAN I have done</p> <p>that?' she thought. `I must be growing small again.' She got up</p> <p>and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,</p> <p>as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,</p> <p>and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the</p> <p>cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it</p> <p>hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p> <p></p> <p>`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at</p> <p>the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in</p> <p>existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed</p> <p>back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut</p> <p>again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as</p> <p>before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,</p> <p>`for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare</p> <p>it's too bad, that it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another</p> <p>moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first</p> <p>idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that</p> <p>case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had</p> <p>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general</p> <p>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find</p> <p>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in</p> <p>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and</p> <p>behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that</p> <p>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine</p> <p>feet high.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,</p> <p>trying to find her way out. `I shall be punished for it now, I</p> <p>suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer</p> <p>thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a</p> <p>little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at</p> <p>first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then</p> <p>she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that</p> <p>it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this</p> <p>mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should</p> <p>think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in</p> <p>trying.' So she began: `O Mouse, do you know the way out of</p> <p>this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'</p> <p>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:</p> <p>she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having</p> <p>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a</p> <p>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather</p> <p>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little</p> <p>eyes, but it said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I</p> <p>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the</p> <p>Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had</p> <p>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she</p> <p>began again: `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in</p> <p>her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the</p> <p>water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg</p> <p>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the</p> <p>poor animal's feelings. `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate</p> <p>voice. `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: `don't be</p> <p>angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:</p> <p>I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</p> <p>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,</p> <p>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so</p> <p>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and</p> <p>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital</p> <p>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,</p> <p>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt</p> <p>certain it must be really offended. `We won't talk about her any</p> <p>more if you'd rather not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end</p> <p>of his tail. `As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family</p> <p>always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear</p> <p>the name again!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the</p> <p>subject of conversation. `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'</p> <p>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: `There is</p> <p>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</p> <p>A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly</p> <p>brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and</p> <p>it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I</p> <p>can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you</p> <p>know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!</p> <p>He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the</p> <p>Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and</p> <p>making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p> <p></p> <p> So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear! Do come back</p> <p>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't</p> <p>like them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam</p> <p>slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice</p> <p>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to</p> <p>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll</p> <p>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded</p> <p>with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a</p> <p>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious</p> <p>creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the</p> <p>shore.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER III</p> <p></p> <p> A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the</p> <p>bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their</p> <p>fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and</p> <p>uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they</p> <p>had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed</p> <p>quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with</p> <p>them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had</p> <p>quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,</p> <p>and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';</p> <p>and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,</p> <p>and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no</p> <p>more to be said.</p> <p></p> <p> At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among</p> <p>them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL</p> <p>soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large</p> <p>ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes</p> <p>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad</p> <p>cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?</p> <p>This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!</p> <p>"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was</p> <p>soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been</p> <p>of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very</p> <p>politely: `Did you speak?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought you did,' said the Mouse. `--I proceed. "Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:</p> <p>and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found</p> <p>it advisable--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.</p> <p></p> <p> `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: `of course you</p> <p>know what "it" means.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said</p> <p>the Duck: `it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is,</p> <p>what did the archbishop find?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,</p> <p>`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William</p> <p>and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was</p> <p>moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you</p> <p>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it</p> <p>spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: `it doesn't</p> <p>seem to dry me at all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I</p> <p>move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more</p> <p>energetic remedies--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak English!' said the Eaglet. `I don't know the meaning of</p> <p>half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do</p> <p>either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:</p> <p>some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p> <p></p> <p> `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,</p> <p>`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much</p> <p>to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY</p> <p>ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'</p> <p>(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter</p> <p>day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p> <p></p> <p> First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the</p> <p>exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party</p> <p>were placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One,</p> <p>two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,</p> <p>and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know</p> <p>when the race was over. However, when they had been running half</p> <p>an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called</p> <p>out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,</p> <p>and asking, `But who has won?'</p> <p></p> <p> This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of</p> <p>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon</p> <p>its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,</p> <p>in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At</p> <p>last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have</p> <p>prizes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices</p> <p>asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with</p> <p>one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,</p> <p>calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand</p> <p>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt</p> <p>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</p> <p>There was exactly one a-piece all round.</p> <p></p> <p> `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have</p> <p>you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.</p> <p></p> <p> Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo</p> <p>solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of</p> <p>this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short</p> <p>speech, they all cheered.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked</p> <p>so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not</p> <p>think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,</p> <p>looking as solemn as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise</p> <p>and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not</p> <p>taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on</p> <p>the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again</p> <p>in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p> <p></p> <p> `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,</p> <p>`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half</p> <p>afraid that it would be offended again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to</p> <p>Alice, and sighing.</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with</p> <p>wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And</p> <p>she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so</p> <p>that her idea of the tale was something like this:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Fury said to a</p> <p> mouse, That he</p> <p> met in the</p> <p> house,</p> <p> "Let us</p> <p> both go to</p> <p> law: I will</p> <p> prosecute</p> <p> YOU. --Come,</p> <p> I'll take no</p> <p> denial; We</p> <p> must have a</p> <p> trial: For</p> <p> really this</p> <p> morning I've</p> <p> nothing</p> <p> to do."</p> <p> Said the</p> <p> mouse to the</p> <p> cur, "Such</p> <p> a trial,</p> <p> dear Sir,</p> <p> With</p> <p> no jury</p> <p> or judge,</p> <p> would be</p> <p> wasting</p> <p> our</p> <p> breath."</p> <p> "I'll be</p> <p> judge, I'll</p> <p> be jury,"</p> <p> Said</p> <p> cunning</p> <p> old Fury:</p> <p> "I'll</p> <p> try the</p> <p> whole</p> <p> cause,</p> <p> and</p> <p> condemn</p> <p> you</p> <p> to</p> <p> death."'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.</p> <p>`What are you thinking of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to</p> <p>the fifth bend, I think?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up</p> <p>and walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily</p> <p>offended, you know!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse only growled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after</p> <p>it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but</p> <p>the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little</p> <p>quicker.</p> <p></p> <p> `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it</p> <p>was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of</p> <p>saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you</p> <p>never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the</p> <p>young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the</p> <p>patience of an oyster!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,</p> <p>addressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'</p> <p>said the Lory.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about</p> <p>her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for</p> <p>catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her</p> <p>after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look</p> <p>at it!'</p> <p></p> <p> This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</p> <p>Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began</p> <p>wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be</p> <p>getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary</p> <p>called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my</p> <p>dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts</p> <p>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a</p> <p>melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm</p> <p>sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I</p> <p>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice</p> <p>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</p> <p>In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of</p> <p>footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping</p> <p>that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to</p> <p>finish his story.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IV</p> <p></p> <p> The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;</p> <p>and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!</p> <p>Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me</p> <p>executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have</p> <p>dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was</p> <p>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she</p> <p>very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were</p> <p>nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her</p> <p>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and</p> <p>the little door, had vanished completely.</p> <p></p> <p> Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,</p> <p>and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE</p> <p>you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of</p> <p>gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened</p> <p>that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without</p> <p>trying to explain the mistake it had made.</p> <p></p> <p> `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.</p> <p>`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd</p> <p>better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'</p> <p>As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door</p> <p>of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'</p> <p>engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried</p> <p>upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,</p> <p>and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and</p> <p>gloves.</p> <p></p> <p> `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going</p> <p>messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on</p> <p>messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that</p> <p>would happen: `"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready</p> <p>for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see</p> <p>that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went</p> <p>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering</p> <p>people about like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with</p> <p>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two</p> <p>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and</p> <p>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when</p> <p>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-</p> <p>glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'</p> <p>but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know</p> <p>SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,</p> <p>`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this</p> <p>bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for</p> <p>really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'</p> <p></p> <p> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:</p> <p>before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing</p> <p>against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being</p> <p>broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself</p> <p>`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I</p> <p>can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so</p> <p>much!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and</p> <p>growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in</p> <p>another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried</p> <p>the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the</p> <p>other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,</p> <p>as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one</p> <p>foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,</p> <p>whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'</p> <p></p> <p> Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full</p> <p>effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,</p> <p>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting</p> <p>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one</p> <p>wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about</p> <p>by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that</p> <p>rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,</p> <p>this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!</p> <p>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing</p> <p>never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There</p> <p>ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when</p> <p>I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more</p> <p>HERE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I</p> <p>am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--</p> <p>but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you</p> <p>learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no</p> <p>room at all for any lesson-books!'</p> <p></p> <p> And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,</p> <p>and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few</p> <p>minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves</p> <p>this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the</p> <p>stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and</p> <p>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she</p> <p>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no</p> <p>reason to be afraid of it.</p> <p></p> <p> Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;</p> <p>but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed</p> <p>hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it</p> <p>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she</p> <p>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly</p> <p>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not</p> <p>get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,</p> <p>and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was</p> <p>just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something</p> <p>of the sort.</p> <p></p> <p> Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are</p> <p>you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then</p> <p>I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!</p> <p>Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')</p> <p></p> <p> `An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it</p> <p>fills the whole window!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it</p> <p>away!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear</p> <p>whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer</p> <p>honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at</p> <p>last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in</p> <p>the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more</p> <p>sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there</p> <p>must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for</p> <p>pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I</p> <p>don't want to stay in here any longer!'</p> <p></p> <p> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at</p> <p>last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a</p> <p>good many voices all talking together: she made out the words:</p> <p>`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;</p> <p>Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up</p> <p>at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half</p> <p>high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--</p> <p>Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind</p> <p>that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud</p> <p>crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go</p> <p>down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,</p> <p>then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to</p> <p>go down the chimney!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said</p> <p>Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!</p> <p>I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is</p> <p>narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'</p> <p></p> <p> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and</p> <p>waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what</p> <p>sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close</p> <p>above her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one</p> <p>sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes</p> <p>Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the</p> <p>hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold</p> <p>up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?</p> <p>What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'</p> <p></p> <p> Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'</p> <p>thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm</p> <p>better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know</p> <p>is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes</p> <p>like a sky-rocket!'</p> <p></p> <p> `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and</p> <p>Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do. I'll set</p> <p>Dinah at you!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to</p> <p>herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any</p> <p>sense, they'd take the roof off.' After a minute or two, they</p> <p>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A</p> <p>barrowful will do, to begin with.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to</p> <p>doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came</p> <p>rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.</p> <p>`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,</p> <p>`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead</p> <p>silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all</p> <p>turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright</p> <p>idea came into her head. `If I eat one of these cakes,' she</p> <p>thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it</p> <p>can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I</p> <p>suppose.'</p> <p></p> <p> So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find</p> <p>that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small</p> <p>enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and</p> <p>found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.</p> <p>The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by</p> <p>two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.</p> <p>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she</p> <p>ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a</p> <p>thick wood.</p> <p></p> <p> `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she</p> <p>wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;</p> <p>and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</p> <p>I think that will be the best plan.'</p> <p></p> <p> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and</p> <p>simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the</p> <p>smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering</p> <p>about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over</p> <p>her head made her look up in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round</p> <p>eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</p> <p>`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried</p> <p>hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the</p> <p>time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it</p> <p>would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</p> <p></p> <p> Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of</p> <p>stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped</p> <p>into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,</p> <p>and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice</p> <p>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run</p> <p>over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy</p> <p>made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in</p> <p>its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very</p> <p>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every</p> <p>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle</p> <p>again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the</p> <p>stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long</p> <p>way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat</p> <p>down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its</p> <p>mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p> <p></p> <p> This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;</p> <p>so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out</p> <p>of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the</p> <p>distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she</p> <p>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself</p> <p>with one of the leaves: `I should have liked teaching it tricks</p> <p>very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh</p> <p>dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let</p> <p>me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or</p> <p>drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'</p> <p></p> <p> The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round</p> <p>her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see</p> <p>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under</p> <p>the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,</p> <p>about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under</p> <p>it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her</p> <p>that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.</p> <p></p> <p> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of</p> <p>the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large</p> <p>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,</p> <p>quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice</p> <p>of her or of anything else.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER V</p> <p></p> <p> Advice from a Caterpillar</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in</p> <p>silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice</p> <p>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--</p> <p>at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think</p> <p>I must have been changed several times since then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</p> <p>`Explain yourself!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because</p> <p>I'm not myself, you see.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very</p> <p>politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and</p> <p>being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but</p> <p>when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you</p> <p>know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll</p> <p>feel it a little queer, won't you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;</p> <p>`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. `Who are YOU?'</p> <p></p> <p> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the</p> <p>conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's</p> <p>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,</p> <p>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not</p> <p>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in</p> <p>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. `I've something</p> <p>important to say!'</p> <p></p> <p> This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as</p> <p>she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else</p> <p>to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth</p> <p>hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but</p> <p>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth</p> <p>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as</p> <p>I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it</p> <p>all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice folded her hands, and began:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,</p> <p> `And your hair has become very white;</p> <p> And yet you incessantly stand on your head--</p> <p> Do you think, at your age, it is right?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,</p> <p> `I feared it might injure the brain;</p> <p> But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,</p> <p> Why, I do it again and again.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,</p> <p> And have grown most uncommonly fat;</p> <p> Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--</p> <p> Pray, what is the reason of that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</p> <p> `I kept all my limbs very supple</p> <p> By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--</p> <p> Allow me to sell you a couple?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak</p> <p> For anything tougher than suet;</p> <p> Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--</p> <p> Pray how did you manage to do it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,</p> <p> And argued each case with my wife;</p> <p> And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,</p> <p> Has lasted the rest of my life.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose</p> <p> That your eye was as steady as ever;</p> <p> Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--</p> <p> What made you so awfully clever?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'</p> <p> Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!</p> <p> Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?</p> <p> Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the</p> <p>words have got altered.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.</p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar was the first to speak.</p> <p></p> <p> `What size do you want to be?' it asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;</p> <p>`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in</p> <p>her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you</p> <p>wouldn't mind,' said Alice: `three inches is such a wretched</p> <p>height to be.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three</p> <p>inches high).</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</p> <p>And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so</p> <p>easily offended!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it</p> <p>put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</p> <p></p> <p> This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</p> <p>In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got</p> <p>down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely</p> <p>remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and</p> <p>the other side will make you grow shorter.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had</p> <p>asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a</p> <p>minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as</p> <p>it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</p> <p>However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they</p> <p>would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p> <p></p> <p> `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a</p> <p>little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment</p> <p>she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her</p> <p>foot!</p> <p></p> <p> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but</p> <p>she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking</p> <p>rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.</p> <p>Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was</p> <p>hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and</p> <p>managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of</p> <p>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she</p> <p>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could</p> <p>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which</p> <p>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay</p> <p>far below her.</p> <p></p> <p> `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. `And where</p> <p>HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I</p> <p>can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no</p> <p>result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the</p> <p>distant green leaves.</p> <p></p> <p> As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her</p> <p>head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted</p> <p>to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,</p> <p>like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a</p> <p>graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which</p> <p>she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she</p> <p>had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a</p> <p>hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating</p> <p>her violently with its wings.</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. `Let me alone!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more</p> <p>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every</p> <p>way, and nothing seems to suit them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've</p> <p>tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but</p> <p>those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no</p> <p>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</p> <p></p> <p> `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the</p> <p>Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and</p> <p>day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was</p> <p>beginning to see its meaning.</p> <p></p> <p> `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued</p> <p>the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was</p> <p>thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come</p> <p>wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. `I'm a--I'm</p> <p>a--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're</p> <p>trying to invent something!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she</p> <p>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the</p> <p>deepest contempt. `I've seen a good many little girls in my</p> <p>time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a</p> <p>serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be</p> <p>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very</p> <p>truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as</p> <p>serpents do, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why</p> <p>then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent</p> <p>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of</p> <p>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and</p> <p>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a</p> <p>serpent?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm</p> <p>not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't</p> <p>want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it</p> <p>settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the</p> <p>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled</p> <p>among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and</p> <p>untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the</p> <p>pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very</p> <p>carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and</p> <p>growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had</p> <p>succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p> <p></p> <p> It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,</p> <p>that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a</p> <p>few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come,</p> <p>there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes</p> <p>are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to</p> <p>another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next</p> <p>thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be</p> <p>done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an</p> <p>open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</p> <p>`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come</p> <p>upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their</p> <p>wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did</p> <p>not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself</p> <p>down to nine inches high.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VI</p> <p></p> <p> Pig and Pepper</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and</p> <p>wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came</p> <p>running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman</p> <p>because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only,</p> <p>she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door</p> <p>with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,</p> <p>with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,</p> <p>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their</p> <p>heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and</p> <p>crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great</p> <p>letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to</p> <p>the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess. An</p> <p>invitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman</p> <p>repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the</p> <p>words a little, `From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess</p> <p>to play croquet.'</p> <p></p> <p> Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled</p> <p>together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into</p> <p>the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped</p> <p>out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the</p> <p>ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and</p> <p>that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the</p> <p>door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise</p> <p>inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was</p> <p>a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling</p> <p>and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish</p> <p>or kettle had been broken to pieces.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'</p> <p></p> <p> `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went</p> <p>on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us. For</p> <p>instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let</p> <p>you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time</p> <p>he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. `But</p> <p>perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so</p> <p>VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might</p> <p>answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate</p> <p>came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just</p> <p>grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees</p> <p>behind him.</p> <p></p> <p> `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,</p> <p>exactly as if nothing had happened.</p> <p></p> <p> `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. `That's the</p> <p>first question, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.</p> <p>`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the</p> <p>creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for</p> <p>repeating his remark, with variations. `I shall sit here,' he</p> <p>said, `on and off, for days and days.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what am I to do?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:</p> <p>`he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.</p> <p></p> <p> The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of</p> <p>smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a</p> <p>three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was</p> <p>leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to</p> <p>be full of soup.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to</p> <p>herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p> <p></p> <p> There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the</p> <p>Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was</p> <p>sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The</p> <p>only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,</p> <p>and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from</p> <p>ear to ear.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for</p> <p>she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to</p> <p>speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!'</p> <p></p> <p> She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice</p> <p>quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed</p> <p>to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I</p> <p>didn't know that cats COULD grin.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,</p> <p>feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</p> <p></p> <p> `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought</p> <p>it would be as well to introduce some other subject of</p> <p>conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took</p> <p>the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work</p> <p>throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby</p> <p>--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,</p> <p>plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when</p> <p>they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it</p> <p>was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up</p> <p>and down in an agony of terror. `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS</p> <p>nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very</p> <p>nearly carried it off.</p> <p></p> <p> `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a</p> <p>hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it</p> <p>does.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very</p> <p>glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her</p> <p>knowledge. `Just think of what work it would make with the day</p> <p>and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn</p> <p>round on its axis--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant</p> <p>to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and</p> <p>seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: `Twenty-four</p> <p>hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide</p> <p>figures!' And with that she began nursing her child again,</p> <p>singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a</p> <p>violent shake at the end of every line:</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak roughly to your little boy,</p> <p> And beat him when he sneezes:</p> <p> He only does it to annoy,</p> <p> Because he knows it teases.'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> (In which the cook and the baby joined):--</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept</p> <p>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing</p> <p>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I speak severely to my boy,</p> <p> I beat him when he sneezes;</p> <p> For he can thoroughly enjoy</p> <p> The pepper when he pleases!'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said</p> <p>to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. `I must go and</p> <p>get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of</p> <p>the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,</p> <p>but it just missed her.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-</p> <p>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all</p> <p>directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor</p> <p>little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,</p> <p>and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,</p> <p>so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much</p> <p>as she could do to hold it.</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,</p> <p>(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep</p> <p>tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its</p> <p>undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. `IF I</p> <p>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure</p> <p>to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it</p> <p>behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing</p> <p>grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). `Don't</p> <p>grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing</p> <p>yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into</p> <p>its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no</p> <p>doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout</p> <p>than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for</p> <p>a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at</p> <p>all. `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked</p> <p>into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</p> <p></p> <p> No, there were no tears. `If you're going to turn into a pig,</p> <p>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do</p> <p>with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or</p> <p>grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for</p> <p>some while in silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I</p> <p>to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted</p> <p>again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some</p> <p>alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was</p> <p>neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be</p> <p>quite absurd for her to carry it further.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to</p> <p>see it trot away quietly into the wood. `If it had grown up,'</p> <p>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:</p> <p>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began</p> <p>thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as</p> <p>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right</p> <p>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing</p> <p>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-</p> <p>natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great</p> <p>many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p> <p></p> <p> `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at</p> <p>all know whether it would like the name: however, it only</p> <p>grinned a little wider. `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought</p> <p>Alice, and she went on. `Would you tell me, please, which way I</p> <p>ought to go from here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said</p> <p>the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't much care where--' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk</p> <p>long enough.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another</p> <p>question. `What sort of people live about here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,</p> <p>`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,</p> <p>`lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.</p> <p>I'm mad. You're mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on</p> <p>`And how do you know that you're mad?'</p> <p></p> <p> `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad. You grant</p> <p>that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I suppose so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's</p> <p>angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm</p> <p>pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call it what you like,' said the Cat. `Do you play croquet</p> <p>with the Queen to-day?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been</p> <p>invited yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used</p> <p>to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place</p> <p>where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.</p> <p></p> <p> `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. `I'd</p> <p>nearly forgotten to ask.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had</p> <p>come back in a natural way.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it</p> <p>did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the</p> <p>direction in which the March Hare was said to live. `I've seen</p> <p>hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be</p> <p>much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be</p> <p>raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.' As she said</p> <p>this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a</p> <p>branch of a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep</p> <p>appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'</p> <p></p> <p> `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,</p> <p>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,</p> <p>which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever</p> <p>saw in my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the</p> <p>house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house,</p> <p>because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was</p> <p>thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not</p> <p>like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand</p> <p>bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even</p> <p>then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself</p> <p>`Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd</p> <p>gone to see the Hatter instead!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VII</p> <p></p> <p> A Mad Tea-Party</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,</p> <p>and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a</p> <p>Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two</p> <p>were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking</p> <p>over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p> <p></p> <p> The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded</p> <p>together at one corner of it: `No room! No room!' they cried</p> <p>out when they saw Alice coming. `There's PLENTY of room!' said</p> <p>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one</p> <p>end of the table.</p> <p></p> <p> `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it</p> <p>but tea. `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice</p> <p>angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being</p> <p>invited,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a</p> <p>great many more than three.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been</p> <p>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was</p> <p>his first speech.</p> <p></p> <p> `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said</p> <p>with some severity; `it's very rude.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all</p> <p>he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. `I'm glad</p> <p>they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she</p> <p>added aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'</p> <p>said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what</p> <p>I say--that's the same thing, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. `You might just</p> <p>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat</p> <p>what I see"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I</p> <p>like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to</p> <p>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the</p> <p>same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the</p> <p>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,</p> <p>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and</p> <p>writing-desks, which wasn't much.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter was the first to break the silence. `What day of</p> <p>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his</p> <p>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking</p> <p>it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. `I told you butter</p> <p>wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March</p> <p>Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter</p> <p>grumbled: `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'</p> <p></p> <p> The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then</p> <p>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he</p> <p>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It</p> <p>was the BEST butter, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</p> <p>`What a funny watch!' she remarked. `It tells the day of the</p> <p>month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. `Does YOUR watch tell</p> <p>you what year it is?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: `but that's</p> <p>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to</p> <p>have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</p> <p>`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she</p> <p>could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured</p> <p>a little hot tea upon its nose.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without</p> <p>opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to</p> <p>remark myself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to</p> <p>Alice again.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I give it up,' Alice replied: `what's the answer?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nor I,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice sighed wearily. `I think you might do something better</p> <p>with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that</p> <p>have no answers.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you</p> <p>wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head</p> <p>contemptuously. `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: `but I know I have to</p> <p>beat time when I learn music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. `He won't stand</p> <p>beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do</p> <p>almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose</p> <p>it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:</p> <p>you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the</p> <p>clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'</p> <p></p> <p> (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a</p> <p>whisper.)</p> <p></p> <p> `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:</p> <p>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: `but you could keep</p> <p>it to half-past one as long as you liked.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter shook his head mournfully. `Not I!' he replied.</p> <p>`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'</p> <p>(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the</p> <p>great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing</p> <p></p> <p> "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</p> <p> How I wonder what you're at!"</p> <p></p> <p>You know the song, perhaps?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--</p> <p></p> <p> "Up above the world you fly,</p> <p> Like a tea-tray in the sky.</p> <p> Twinkle, twinkle--"'</p> <p></p> <p>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep</p> <p>`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that</p> <p>they had to pinch it to make it stop.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,</p> <p>`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the</p> <p>time! Off with his head!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,</p> <p>`he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'</p> <p></p> <p> A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so</p> <p>many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always</p> <p>tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice</p> <p>ventured to ask.</p> <p></p> <p> `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,</p> <p>yawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady</p> <p>tells us a story.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at</p> <p>the proposal.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. `Wake up,</p> <p>Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. `I wasn't asleep,' he</p> <p>said in a hoarse, feeble voice: `I heard every word you fellows</p> <p>were saying.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep</p> <p>again before it's done.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the</p> <p>Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,</p> <p>Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great</p> <p>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</p> <p></p> <p> `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a</p> <p>minute or two.</p> <p></p> <p> `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently</p> <p>remarked; `they'd have been ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways</p> <p>of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went</p> <p>on: `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very</p> <p>earnestly.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so</p> <p>I can't take more.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very</p> <p>easy to take MORE than nothing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked</p> <p>triumphantly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped</p> <p>herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the</p> <p>Dormouse, and repeated her question. `Why did they live at the</p> <p>bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and</p> <p>then said, `It was a treacle-well.'</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but</p> <p>the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse</p> <p>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the</p> <p>story for yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt</p> <p>again. I dare say there may be ONE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he</p> <p>consented to go on. `And so these three little sisters--they</p> <p>were learning to draw, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this</p> <p>time.</p> <p></p> <p> `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: `let's all move</p> <p>one place on.'</p> <p></p> <p> He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the</p> <p>March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather</p> <p>unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the</p> <p>only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a</p> <p>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset</p> <p>the milk-jug into his plate.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began</p> <p>very cautiously: `But I don't understand. Where did they draw</p> <p>the treacle from?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so</p> <p>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,</p> <p>stupid?'</p> <p></p> <p> `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not</p> <p>choosing to notice this last remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'</p> <p></p> <p> This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse</p> <p>go on for some time without interrupting it.</p> <p></p> <p> `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and</p> <p>rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew</p> <p>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why with an M?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why not?' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going</p> <p>off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up</p> <p>again with a little shriek, and went on: `--that begins with an</p> <p>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--</p> <p>you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever</p> <p>see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I</p> <p>don't think--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got</p> <p>up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep</p> <p>instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her</p> <p>going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that</p> <p>they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were</p> <p>trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</p> <p></p> <p> `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she</p> <p>picked her way through the wood. `It's the stupidest tea-party I</p> <p>ever was at in all my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a</p> <p>door leading right into it. `That's very curious!' she thought.</p> <p>`But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.'</p> <p>And in she went.</p> <p></p> <p> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the</p> <p>little glass table. `Now, I'll manage better this time,'</p> <p>she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,</p> <p>and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went</p> <p>to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it</p> <p>in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down</p> <p>the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the</p> <p>beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VIII</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's Croquet-Ground</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the</p> <p>roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at</p> <p>it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious</p> <p>thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up</p> <p>to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go</p> <p>splashing paint over me like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged</p> <p>my elbow.'</p> <p></p> <p> On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always</p> <p>lay the blame on others!'</p> <p></p> <p> `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. `I heard the Queen say only</p> <p>yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it</p> <p>was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'</p> <p></p> <p> Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all</p> <p>the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as</p> <p>she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the</p> <p>others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are</p> <p>painting those roses?'</p> <p></p> <p> Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a</p> <p>low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to</p> <p>have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;</p> <p>and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads</p> <p>cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore</p> <p>she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously</p> <p>looking across the garden, called out `The Queen! The Queen!'</p> <p>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon</p> <p>their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice</p> <p>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped</p> <p>like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and</p> <p>feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were</p> <p>ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the</p> <p>soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were</p> <p>ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand</p> <p>in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next</p> <p>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice</p> <p>recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous</p> <p>manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without</p> <p>noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the</p> <p>King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this</p> <p>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on</p> <p>her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember</p> <p>ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,</p> <p>what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people</p> <p>had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'</p> <p>So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p> <p></p> <p> When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped</p> <p>and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'</p> <p>She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,</p> <p>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'</p> <p></p> <p> `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very</p> <p>politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of</p> <p>cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three</p> <p>gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as</p> <p>they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs</p> <p>was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether</p> <p>they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her</p> <p>own children.</p> <p></p> <p> `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</p> <p>`It's no business of MINE.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her</p> <p>for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!</p> <p>Off--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the</p> <p>Queen was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said</p> <p>`Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave</p> <p>`Turn them over!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p> <p></p> <p> `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the</p> <p>three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the</p> <p>King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</p> <p></p> <p> `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. `You make me giddy.'</p> <p>And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you</p> <p>been doing here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,</p> <p>going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the</p> <p>roses. `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,</p> <p>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate</p> <p>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</p> <p></p> <p> `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a</p> <p>large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered</p> <p>about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly</p> <p>marched off after the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers</p> <p>shouted in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's right!' shouted the Queen. `Can you play croquet?'</p> <p></p> <p> The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question</p> <p>was evidently meant for her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes!' shouted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the</p> <p>procession, wondering very much what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.</p> <p>She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously</p> <p>into her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very,' said Alice: `--where's the Duchess?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He</p> <p>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised</p> <p>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and</p> <p>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I didn't,' said Alice: `I don't think it's at all a pity.</p> <p>I said "What for?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a</p> <p>little scream of laughter. `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a</p> <p>frightened tone. `The Queen will hear you! You see, she came</p> <p>rather late, and the Queen said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,</p> <p>and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up</p> <p>against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or</p> <p>two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a</p> <p>curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and</p> <p>furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live</p> <p>flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to</p> <p>stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p> <p></p> <p> The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her</p> <p>flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,</p> <p>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,</p> <p>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened</p> <p>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it</p> <p>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a</p> <p>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:</p> <p>and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,</p> <p>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled</p> <p>itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,</p> <p>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she</p> <p>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers</p> <p>were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the</p> <p>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very</p> <p>difficult game indeed.</p> <p></p> <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns,</p> <p>quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in</p> <p>a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went</p> <p>stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with</p> <p>her head!' about once in a minute.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as</p> <p>yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might</p> <p>happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of</p> <p>me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great</p> <p>wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'</p> <p></p> <p> She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering</p> <p>whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a</p> <p>curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at</p> <p>first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to</p> <p>be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat: now I</p> <p>shall have somebody to talk to.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was</p> <p>mouth enough for it to speak with.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. `It's no</p> <p>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at</p> <p>least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared,</p> <p>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the</p> <p>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The</p> <p>Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and</p> <p>no more of it appeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather</p> <p>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't</p> <p>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in</p> <p>particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and</p> <p>you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;</p> <p>for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next</p> <p>walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have</p> <p>croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it</p> <p>saw mine coming!'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at all,' said Alice: `she's so extremely--' Just then</p> <p>she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so</p> <p>she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while</p> <p>finishing the game.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen smiled and passed on.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and</p> <p>looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: `allow me</p> <p>to introduce it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:</p> <p>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me</p> <p>like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. `I've read that in</p> <p>some book, but I don't remember where.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and</p> <p>he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear! I</p> <p>wish you would have this cat removed!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great</p> <p>or small. `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking</p> <p>round.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and</p> <p>he hurried off.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game</p> <p>was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,</p> <p>screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three</p> <p>of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and</p> <p>she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in</p> <p>such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or</p> <p>not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p> <p></p> <p> The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,</p> <p>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one</p> <p>of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her</p> <p>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where</p> <p>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up</p> <p>into a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,</p> <p>the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:</p> <p>`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches</p> <p>are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away</p> <p>under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for</p> <p>a little more conversation with her friend.</p> <p></p> <p> When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to</p> <p>find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute</p> <p>going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who</p> <p>were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,</p> <p>and looked very uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to</p> <p>settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,</p> <p>though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed</p> <p>to make out exactly what they said.</p> <p></p> <p> The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a</p> <p>head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had</p> <p>never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin</p> <p>at HIS time of life.</p> <p></p> <p> The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be</p> <p>beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about</p> <p>it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.</p> <p>(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so</p> <p>grave and anxious.)</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the</p> <p>Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: `fetch</p> <p>her here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,</p> <p>by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely</p> <p>disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down</p> <p>looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IX</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle's Story</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old</p> <p>thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately</p> <p>into Alice's, and they walked off together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and</p> <p>thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had</p> <p>made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p> `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very</p> <p>hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT</p> <p>ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that</p> <p>makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at</p> <p>having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them</p> <p>sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar</p> <p>and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish</p> <p>people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you</p> <p>know--'</p> <p></p> <p> She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a</p> <p>little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</p> <p>`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you</p> <p>forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that</p> <p>is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. `Everything's got a</p> <p>moral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up</p> <p>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first,</p> <p>because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was</p> <p>exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,</p> <p>and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not</p> <p>like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of</p> <p>keeping up the conversation a little.</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis so,' said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--"Oh,</p> <p>'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody</p> <p>minding their own business!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,</p> <p>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,</p> <p>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the</p> <p>sounds will take care of themselves."'</p> <p></p> <p> `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your</p> <p>waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I'm</p> <p>doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the</p> <p>experiment?'</p> <p></p> <p> `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all</p> <p>anxious to have the experiment tried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very true,' said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both</p> <p>bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock</p> <p>together."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: `what a clear way you</p> <p>have of putting things!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree</p> <p>to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near</p> <p>here. And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the</p> <p>less there is of yours."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this</p> <p>last remark, `it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it</p> <p>is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of</p> <p>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put</p> <p>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than</p> <p>what it might appear to others that what you were or might have</p> <p>been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared</p> <p>to them to be otherwise."'</p> <p></p> <p> `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very</p> <p>politely, `if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it</p> <p>as you say it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess</p> <p>replied, in a pleased tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'</p> <p>said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. `I make you</p> <p>a present of everything I've said as yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. `I'm glad they don't</p> <p>give birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to</p> <p>say it out loud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her</p> <p>sharp little chin.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was</p> <p>beginning to feel a little worried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;</p> <p>and the m--'</p> <p></p> <p> But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died</p> <p>away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the</p> <p>arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up,</p> <p>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,</p> <p>frowning like a thunderstorm.</p> <p></p> <p> `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on</p> <p>the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,</p> <p>and that in about half no time! Take your choice!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p> <p></p> <p> `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice</p> <p>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her</p> <p>back to the croquet-ground.</p> <p></p> <p> The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,</p> <p>and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her,</p> <p>they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a</p> <p>moment's delay would cost them their lives.</p> <p></p> <p> All the time they were playing the Queen never left off</p> <p>quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his</p> <p>head!' or `Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were</p> <p>taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave</p> <p>off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour</p> <p>or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the</p> <p>King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of</p> <p>execution.</p> <p></p> <p> Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to</p> <p>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said Alice. `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his</p> <p>history,'</p> <p></p> <p> As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low</p> <p>voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.' `Come,</p> <p>THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite</p> <p>unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p> <p></p> <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the</p> <p>sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)</p> <p>`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to</p> <p>see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and</p> <p>see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,</p> <p>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like</p> <p>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would</p> <p>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage</p> <p>Queen: so she waited.</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the</p> <p>Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!'</p> <p>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the fun?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. `It's all her fancy, that: they</p> <p>never executes nobody, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went</p> <p>slowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life,</p> <p>never!'</p> <p></p> <p> They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the</p> <p>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,</p> <p>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart</p> <p>would break. She pitied him deeply. `What is his sorrow?' she</p> <p>asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the</p> <p>same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got</p> <p>no sorrow, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with</p> <p>large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to</p> <p>know your history, she do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow</p> <p>tone: `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've</p> <p>finished.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice</p> <p>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he</p> <p>doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.</p> <p></p> <p> `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was</p> <p>a real Turtle.'</p> <p></p> <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only</p> <p>by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and</p> <p>the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very</p> <p>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your</p> <p>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be</p> <p>more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more</p> <p>calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to</p> <p>school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call</p> <p>him Tortoise--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle angrily: `really you are very dull!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple</p> <p>question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and</p> <p>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At</p> <p>last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!</p> <p>Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe</p> <p>it--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak</p> <p>again. The Mock Turtle went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school</p> <p>every day--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be</p> <p>so proud as all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle in a tone of great relief. `Now at OURS they had at the</p> <p>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'</p> <p></p> <p> `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the</p> <p>bottom of the sea.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a</p> <p>sigh. `I only took the regular course.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was that?' inquired Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock</p> <p>Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--</p> <p>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. `What is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. `What! Never</p> <p>heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. `You know what to beautify is,</p> <p>I suppose?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to</p> <p>uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about</p> <p>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you</p> <p>to learn?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting</p> <p>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,</p> <p>with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old</p> <p>conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us</p> <p>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was THAT like?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: `I'm</p> <p>too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics</p> <p>master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he</p> <p>taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;</p> <p>and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a</p> <p>hurry to change the subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the</p> <p>next, and so on.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon</p> <p>remarked: `because they lessen from day to day.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a</p> <p>little before she made her next remark. `Then the eleventh day</p> <p>must have been a holiday?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a</p> <p>very decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER X</p> <p></p> <p> The Lobster Quadrille</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper</p> <p>across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for</p> <p>a minute or two sobs choked his voice. `Same as if he had a bone</p> <p>in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him</p> <p>and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered</p> <p>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--</p> <p>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'</p> <p>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,</p> <p>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful</p> <p>thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, indeed,' said Alice. `What sort of a dance is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;</p> <p>then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `--you advance twice--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: `advance twice, set to</p> <p>partners--'</p> <p></p> <p> `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the</p> <p>Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</p> <p></p> <p> `--as far out to sea as you can--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,</p> <p>capering wildly about.</p> <p></p> <p> `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the</p> <p>Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,</p> <p>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat</p> <p>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very much indeed,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the</p> <p>Gryphon. `We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall</p> <p>sing?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. `I've forgotten the words.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now</p> <p>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and</p> <p>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle</p> <p>sang this, very slowly and sadly:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>`"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.</p> <p>"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my</p> <p> tail.</p> <p>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</p> <p>They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be</p> <p>When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to</p> <p> sea!"</p> <p>But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look</p> <p> askance--</p> <p>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the</p> <p> dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p></p> <p>`"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.</p> <p>"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.</p> <p>The further off from England the nearer is to France--</p> <p>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</p> <p></p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p> dance?</p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p> dance?"'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said</p> <p>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: `and I do so</p> <p>like that curious song about the whiting!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've</p> <p>seen them, of course?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she</p> <p>checked herself hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but</p> <p>if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're</p> <p>like.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. `They have their</p> <p>tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:</p> <p>`crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails</p> <p>in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle</p> <p>yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all</p> <p>that,' he said to the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with</p> <p>the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So</p> <p>they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in</p> <p>their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting. I never knew</p> <p>so much about a whiting before.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the</p> <p>Gryphon. `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never thought about it,' said Alice. `Why?'</p> <p></p> <p> `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very</p> <p>solemnly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was thoroughly puzzled. `Does the boots and shoes!' she</p> <p>repeated in a wondering tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. `I</p> <p>mean, what makes them so shiny?'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she</p> <p>gave her answer. `They're done with blacking, I believe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep</p> <p>voice, `are done with a whiting. Now you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great</p> <p>curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather</p> <p>impatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were</p> <p>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep</p> <p>back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>said: `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came</p> <p>to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With</p> <p>what porpoise?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended</p> <p>tone. And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR</p> <p>adventures.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'</p> <p>said Alice a little timidly: `but it's no use going back to</p> <p>yesterday, because I was a different person then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an</p> <p>impatient tone: `explanations take such a dreadful time.'</p> <p></p> <p> So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when</p> <p>she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about</p> <p>it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on</p> <p>each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she</p> <p>gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly</p> <p>quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,</p> <p>FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming</p> <p>different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said</p> <p>`That's very curious.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated</p> <p>thoughtfully. `I should like to hear her try and repeat</p> <p>something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as</p> <p>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said</p> <p>the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat</p> <p>lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'</p> <p>However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so</p> <p>full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was</p> <p>saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,</p> <p> "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."</p> <p> As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose</p> <p> Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,</p> <p> And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,</p> <p> But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,</p> <p> His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]</p> <p></p> <p> `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'</p> <p>said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it</p> <p>sounds uncommon nonsense.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her</p> <p>hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. `Go on with</p> <p>the next verse.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. `How COULD</p> <p>he turn them out with his nose, you know?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was</p> <p>dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the</p> <p>subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:</p> <p>`it begins "I passed by his garden."'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would</p> <p>all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,</p> <p> How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,</p> <p> While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</p> <p> When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,</p> <p> Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:</p> <p> While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,</p> <p> And concluded the banquet--]</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far</p> <p>the most confusing thing I ever heard!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and</p> <p>Alice was only too glad to do so.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the</p> <p>Gryphon went on. `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you</p> <p>a song?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'</p> <p>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather</p> <p>offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her</p> <p>"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes</p> <p>choked with sobs, to sing this:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</p> <p> Waiting in a hot tureen!</p> <p> Who for such dainties would not stoop?</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,</p> <p> Game, or any other dish?</p> <p> Who would not give all else for two</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had</p> <p>just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'</p> <p>was heard in the distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,</p> <p>it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</p> <p></p> <p> `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon</p> <p>only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more</p> <p>faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the</p> <p>melancholy words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XI</p> <p></p> <p> Who Stole the Tarts?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when</p> <p>they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts</p> <p>of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:</p> <p>the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on</p> <p>each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,</p> <p>with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the</p> <p>other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large</p> <p>dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice</p> <p>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'</p> <p>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed</p> <p>to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about</p> <p>her, to pass away the time.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had</p> <p>read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that</p> <p>she knew the name of nearly everything there. `That's the</p> <p>judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'</p> <p></p> <p> The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown</p> <p>over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he</p> <p>did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly</p> <p>not becoming.</p> <p></p> <p> `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve</p> <p>creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because</p> <p>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they</p> <p>are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over</p> <p>to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and</p> <p>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the</p> <p>meaning of it at all. However, `jury-men' would have done just</p> <p>as well.</p> <p></p> <p> The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</p> <p>`What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. `They</p> <p>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in</p> <p>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the</p> <p>trial.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but</p> <p>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in</p> <p>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked</p> <p>anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their</p> <p>shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'</p> <p>on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them</p> <p>didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his</p> <p>neighbour to tell him. `A nice muddle their slates'll be in</p> <p>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,</p> <p>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got</p> <p>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it</p> <p>away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was</p> <p>Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of</p> <p>it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write</p> <p>with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very</p> <p>little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p> <p></p> <p> `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and</p> <p>then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--</p> <p></p> <p> `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,</p> <p> All on a summer day:</p> <p> The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,</p> <p> And took them quite away!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. `There's</p> <p>a great deal to come before that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit</p> <p>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First</p> <p>witness!'</p> <p></p> <p> The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in</p> <p>one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. `I beg</p> <p>pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in: but I</p> <p>hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to have finished,' said the King. `When did you</p> <p>begin?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into</p> <p>the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. `Fourteenth of March, I</p> <p>think it was,' he said.</p> <p></p> <p> `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury</p> <p>eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then</p> <p>added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</p> <p></p> <p> `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who</p> <p>instantly made a memorandum of the fact.</p> <p></p> <p> `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;</p> <p>`I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'</p> <p></p> <p> Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or</p> <p>I'll have you executed on the spot.'</p> <p></p> <p> This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept</p> <p>shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the</p> <p>Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his</p> <p>teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.</p> <p></p> <p> Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which</p> <p>puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was</p> <p>beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she</p> <p>would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she</p> <p>decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for</p> <p>her.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was</p> <p>sitting next to her. `I can hardly breathe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: `I'm growing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: `you know</p> <p>you're growing too.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:</p> <p>`not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily</p> <p>and crossed over to the other side of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to</p> <p>one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the</p> <p>singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter</p> <p>trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have</p> <p>you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a</p> <p>trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week</p> <p>or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and</p> <p>the twinkling of the tea--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.</p> <p>`Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things</p> <p>twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did!' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `I deny it!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `He denies it,' said the King: `leave out that part.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,</p> <p>looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the</p> <p>Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</p> <p></p> <p> `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-</p> <p>and-butter--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you</p> <p>executed.'</p> <p></p> <p> The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,</p> <p>and went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he</p> <p>began.</p> <p></p> <p> `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately</p> <p>suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a</p> <p>hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had</p> <p>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:</p> <p>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat</p> <p>upon it.)</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've so often</p> <p>read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some</p> <p>attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the</p> <p>officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant</p> <p>till now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'</p> <p>continued the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as</p> <p>it is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.</p> <p></p> <p> Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. `Now we</p> <p>shall get on better.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious</p> <p>look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</p> <p></p> <p> `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the</p> <p>court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.</p> <p></p> <p> `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one</p> <p>of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the</p> <p>officer could get to the door.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the next witness!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the</p> <p>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before</p> <p>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began</p> <p>sneezing all at once.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shan't,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a</p> <p>low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy</p> <p>air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till</p> <p>his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What</p> <p>are tarts made of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead that</p> <p>Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch</p> <p>him! Off with his whiskers!'</p> <p></p> <p> For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the</p> <p>Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down</p> <p>again, the cook had disappeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.</p> <p>`Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the</p> <p>Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.</p> <p>It quite makes my forehead ache!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,</p> <p>feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,</p> <p>`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.</p> <p>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top</p> <p>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XII</p> <p></p> <p> Alice's Evidence</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the</p> <p>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she</p> <p>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with</p> <p>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads</p> <p>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding</p> <p>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset</p> <p>the week before.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great</p> <p>dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,</p> <p>for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and</p> <p>she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once</p> <p>and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</p> <p></p> <p> `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave</p> <p>voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--</p> <p>ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as</p> <p>he said do.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she</p> <p>had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing</p> <p>was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable</p> <p>to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that</p> <p>it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it</p> <p>would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of</p> <p>being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and</p> <p>handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write</p> <p>out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed</p> <p>too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,</p> <p>gazing up into the roof of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you know about this business?' the King said to</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.</p> <p>They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when</p> <p>the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,</p> <p>of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and</p> <p>making faces at him as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and</p> <p>went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--</p> <p>unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word</p> <p>sounded best.</p> <p></p> <p> Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some</p> <p>`unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to</p> <p>look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she</p> <p>thought to herself.</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily</p> <p>writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out</p> <p>from his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE</p> <p>HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'</p> <p></p> <p> Everybody looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You are,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides,</p> <p>that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</p> <p>`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said</p> <p>the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has</p> <p>just been picked up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What's in it?' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems</p> <p>to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was</p> <p>written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,</p> <p>there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper</p> <p>as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set</p> <p>of verses.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of</p> <p>the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the</p> <p>queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)</p> <p></p> <p> `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.</p> <p>(The jury all brightened up again.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and</p> <p>they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the</p> <p>matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd</p> <p>have signed your name like an honest man.'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the</p> <p>first really clever thing the King had said that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't</p> <p>even know what they're about!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Read them,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,</p> <p>please your Majesty?' he asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on</p> <p>till you come to the end: then stop.'</p> <p></p> <p> These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--</p> <p></p> <p> `They told me you had been to her,</p> <p> And mentioned me to him:</p> <p> She gave me a good character,</p> <p> But said I could not swim.</p> <p></p> <p> He sent them word I had not gone</p> <p> (We know it to be true):</p> <p> If she should push the matter on,</p> <p> What would become of you?</p> <p></p> <p> I gave her one, they gave him two,</p> <p> You gave us three or more;</p> <p> They all returned from him to you,</p> <p> Though they were mine before.</p> <p></p> <p> If I or she should chance to be</p> <p> Involved in this affair,</p> <p> He trusts to you to set them free,</p> <p> Exactly as we were.</p> <p></p> <p> My notion was that you had been</p> <p> (Before she had this fit)</p> <p> An obstacle that came between</p> <p> Him, and ourselves, and it.</p> <p></p> <p> Don't let him know she liked them best,</p> <p> For this must ever be</p> <p> A secret, kept from all the rest,</p> <p> Between yourself and me.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'</p> <p>said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'</p> <p></p> <p> `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had</p> <p>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit</p> <p>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't</p> <p>believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'</p> <p></p> <p> The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe</p> <p>there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to</p> <p>explain the paper.</p> <p></p> <p> `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a</p> <p>world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And</p> <p>yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his</p> <p>knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some</p> <p>meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you</p> <p>can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.</p> <p>(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)</p> <p></p> <p> `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering</p> <p>over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's</p> <p>the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,</p> <p>that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to</p> <p>the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.</p> <p>Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my</p> <p>dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the</p> <p>Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off</p> <p>writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no</p> <p>mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was</p> <p>trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round</p> <p>the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and</p> <p>everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the</p> <p>King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having</p> <p>the sentence first!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't!' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</p> <p>Nobody moved.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full</p> <p>size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'</p> <p></p> <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying</p> <p>down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half</p> <p>of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on</p> <p>the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently</p> <p>brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the</p> <p>trees upon her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long</p> <p>sleep you've had!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told</p> <p>her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange</p> <p>Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and</p> <p>when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a</p> <p>curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's</p> <p>getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she</p> <p>ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</p> <p></p> <p> But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her</p> <p>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of</p> <p>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began</p> <p>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--</p> <p></p> <p> First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the</p> <p>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes</p> <p>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her</p> <p>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back</p> <p>the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and</p> <p>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place</p> <p>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little</p> <p>sister's dream.</p> <p></p> <p> The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried</p> <p>by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the</p> <p>neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as</p> <p>the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,</p> <p>and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate</p> <p>guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the</p> <p>Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once</p> <p>more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's</p> <p>slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,</p> <p>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable</p> <p>Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in</p> <p>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and</p> <p>all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only</p> <p>rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the</p> <p>reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-</p> <p>bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd</p> <p>boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and</p> <p>all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the</p> <p>confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the</p> <p>cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's</p> <p>heavy sobs.</p> <p></p> <p> Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of</p> <p>hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how</p> <p>she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and</p> <p>loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about</p> <p>her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager</p> <p>with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of</p> <p>Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their</p> <p>simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,</p> <p>remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</p> <p></p> <p> THE END</p>
ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND</p> <p></p> <p> Lewis Carroll</p> <p></p> <p> THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER I</p> <p></p> <p> Down the Rabbit-Hole</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister</p> <p>on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had</p> <p>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no</p> <p>pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'</p> <p>thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'</p> <p></p> <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,</p> <p>for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether</p> <p>the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble</p> <p>of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White</p> <p>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p> <p></p> <p> There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice</p> <p>think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to</p> <p>itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought</p> <p>it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have</p> <p>wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);</p> <p>but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-</p> <p>POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to</p> <p>her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never</p> <p>before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to</p> <p>take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the</p> <p>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop</p> <p>down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p> <p></p> <p> In another moment down went Alice after it, never once</p> <p>considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,</p> <p>and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a</p> <p>moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself</p> <p>falling down a very deep well.</p> <p></p> <p> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she</p> <p>had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to</p> <p>wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look</p> <p>down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to</p> <p>see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and</p> <p>noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;</p> <p>here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She</p> <p>took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was</p> <p>labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it</p> <p>was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing</p> <p>somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she</p> <p>fell past it.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I</p> <p>shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll</p> <p>all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,</p> <p>even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely</p> <p>true.)</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! `I</p> <p>wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.</p> <p>`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let</p> <p>me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,</p> <p>you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her</p> <p>lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good</p> <p>opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to</p> <p>listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,</p> <p>that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude</p> <p>or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,</p> <p>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to</p> <p>say.)</p> <p></p> <p> Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right</p> <p>THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the</p> <p>people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I</p> <p>think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this</p> <p>time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall</p> <p>have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.</p> <p>Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried</p> <p>to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling</p> <p>through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what</p> <p>an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll</p> <p>never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon</p> <p>began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I</p> <p>should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember</p> <p>her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were</p> <p>down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but</p> <p>you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.</p> <p>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get</p> <p>rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of</p> <p>way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do</p> <p>bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either</p> <p>question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt</p> <p>that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she</p> <p>was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very</p> <p>earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a</p> <p>bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of</p> <p>sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a</p> <p>moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her</p> <p>was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in</p> <p>sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:</p> <p>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it</p> <p>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late</p> <p>it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the</p> <p>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found</p> <p>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps</p> <p>hanging from the roof.</p> <p></p> <p> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;</p> <p>and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the</p> <p>other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,</p> <p>wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of</p> <p>solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,</p> <p>and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the</p> <p>doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or</p> <p>the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of</p> <p>them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low</p> <p>curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little</p> <p>door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key</p> <p>in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p> <p></p> <p> Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small</p> <p>passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and</p> <p>looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</p> <p>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about</p> <p>among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but</p> <p>she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if</p> <p>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of</p> <p>very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish</p> <p>I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only</p> <p>know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things</p> <p>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few</p> <p>things indeed were really impossible.</p> <p></p> <p> There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she</p> <p>went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on</p> <p>it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like</p> <p>telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which</p> <p>certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck</p> <p>of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'</p> <p>beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p> <p></p> <p> It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little</p> <p>Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look</p> <p>first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';</p> <p>for she had read several nice little histories about children who</p> <p>had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant</p> <p>things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules</p> <p>their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker</p> <p>will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your</p> <p>finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had</p> <p>never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked</p> <p>`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or</p> <p>later.</p> <p></p> <p> However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured</p> <p>to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort</p> <p>of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast</p> <p>turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished</p> <p>it off.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up</p> <p>like a telescope.'</p> <p></p> <p> And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and</p> <p>her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right</p> <p>size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.</p> <p>First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was</p> <p>going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about</p> <p>this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my</p> <p>going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be</p> <p>like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is</p> <p>like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember</p> <p>ever having seen such a thing.</p> <p></p> <p> After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided</p> <p>on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!</p> <p>when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the</p> <p>little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,</p> <p>she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it</p> <p>quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb</p> <p>up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;</p> <p>and when she had tired herself out with trying,</p> <p>the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to</p> <p>herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'</p> <p>She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very</p> <p>seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so</p> <p>severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered</p> <p>trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game</p> <p>of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious</p> <p>child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no</p> <p>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why,</p> <p>there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable</p> <p>person!'</p> <p></p> <p> Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under</p> <p>the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on</p> <p>which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.</p> <p>`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,</p> <p>I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep</p> <p>under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I</p> <p>don't care which happens!'</p> <p></p> <p> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which</p> <p>way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to</p> <p>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to</p> <p>find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally</p> <p>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the</p> <p>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,</p> <p>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the</p> <p>common way.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER II</p> <p></p> <p> The Pool of Tears</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much</p> <p>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good</p> <p>English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that</p> <p>ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her</p> <p>feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so</p> <p>far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on</p> <p>your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't</p> <p>be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself</p> <p>about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be</p> <p>kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the</p> <p>way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of</p> <p>boots every Christmas.'</p> <p></p> <p> And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.</p> <p>`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll</p> <p>seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the</p> <p>directions will look!</p> <p></p> <p> ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</p> <p> HEARTHRUG,</p> <p> NEAR THE FENDER,</p> <p> (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).</p> <p></p> <p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in</p> <p>fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took</p> <p>up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p> <p></p> <p> Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one</p> <p>side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get</p> <p>through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to</p> <p>cry again.</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great</p> <p>girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in</p> <p>this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all</p> <p>the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool</p> <p>all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the</p> <p>hall.</p> <p></p> <p> After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the</p> <p>distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p> <p>It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a</p> <p>pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the</p> <p>other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to</p> <p>himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she</p> <p>be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate</p> <p>that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit</p> <p>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,</p> <p>sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid</p> <p>gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard</p> <p>as he could go.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very</p> <p>hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:</p> <p>`Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday</p> <p>things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in</p> <p>the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this</p> <p>morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little</p> <p>different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in</p> <p>the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began</p> <p>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age</p> <p>as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of</p> <p>them.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such</p> <p>long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm</p> <p>sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,</p> <p>oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,</p> <p>and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the</p> <p>things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,</p> <p>and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!</p> <p>I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the</p> <p>Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.</p> <p>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,</p> <p>and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been</p> <p>changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'</p> <p>and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,</p> <p>and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and</p> <p>strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--</p> <p></p> <p> `How doth the little crocodile</p> <p> Improve his shining tail,</p> <p> And pour the waters of the Nile</p> <p> On every golden scale!</p> <p></p> <p> `How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p> <p> How neatly spread his claws,</p> <p> And welcome little fishes in</p> <p> With gently smiling jaws!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and</p> <p>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel</p> <p>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little</p> <p>house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so</p> <p>many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm</p> <p>Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their</p> <p>heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look</p> <p>up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I</p> <p>like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down</p> <p>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a</p> <p>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads</p> <p>down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was</p> <p>surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little</p> <p>white kid gloves while she was talking. `How CAN I have done</p> <p>that?' she thought. `I must be growing small again.' She got up</p> <p>and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,</p> <p>as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,</p> <p>and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the</p> <p>cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it</p> <p>hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p> <p></p> <p>`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at</p> <p>the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in</p> <p>existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed</p> <p>back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut</p> <p>again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as</p> <p>before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,</p> <p>`for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare</p> <p>it's too bad, that it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another</p> <p>moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first</p> <p>idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that</p> <p>case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had</p> <p>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general</p> <p>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find</p> <p>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in</p> <p>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and</p> <p>behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that</p> <p>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine</p> <p>feet high.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,</p> <p>trying to find her way out. `I shall be punished for it now, I</p> <p>suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer</p> <p>thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a</p> <p>little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at</p> <p>first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then</p> <p>she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that</p> <p>it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this</p> <p>mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should</p> <p>think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in</p> <p>trying.' So she began: `O Mouse, do you know the way out of</p> <p>this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'</p> <p>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:</p> <p>she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having</p> <p>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a</p> <p>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather</p> <p>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little</p> <p>eyes, but it said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I</p> <p>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the</p> <p>Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had</p> <p>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she</p> <p>began again: `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in</p> <p>her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the</p> <p>water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg</p> <p>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the</p> <p>poor animal's feelings. `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate</p> <p>voice. `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: `don't be</p> <p>angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:</p> <p>I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</p> <p>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,</p> <p>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so</p> <p>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and</p> <p>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital</p> <p>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,</p> <p>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt</p> <p>certain it must be really offended. `We won't talk about her any</p> <p>more if you'd rather not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end</p> <p>of his tail. `As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family</p> <p>always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear</p> <p>the name again!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the</p> <p>subject of conversation. `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'</p> <p>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: `There is</p> <p>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</p> <p>A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly</p> <p>brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and</p> <p>it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I</p> <p>can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you</p> <p>know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!</p> <p>He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the</p> <p>Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and</p> <p>making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p> <p></p> <p> So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear! Do come back</p> <p>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't</p> <p>like them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam</p> <p>slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice</p> <p>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to</p> <p>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll</p> <p>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded</p> <p>with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a</p> <p>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious</p> <p>creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the</p> <p>shore.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER III</p> <p></p> <p> A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the</p> <p>bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their</p> <p>fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and</p> <p>uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they</p> <p>had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed</p> <p>quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with</p> <p>them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had</p> <p>quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,</p> <p>and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';</p> <p>and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,</p> <p>and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no</p> <p>more to be said.</p> <p></p> <p> At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among</p> <p>them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL</p> <p>soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large</p> <p>ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes</p> <p>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad</p> <p>cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?</p> <p>This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!</p> <p>"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was</p> <p>soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been</p> <p>of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very</p> <p>politely: `Did you speak?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought you did,' said the Mouse. `--I proceed. "Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:</p> <p>and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found</p> <p>it advisable--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.</p> <p></p> <p> `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: `of course you</p> <p>know what "it" means.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said</p> <p>the Duck: `it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is,</p> <p>what did the archbishop find?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,</p> <p>`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William</p> <p>and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was</p> <p>moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you</p> <p>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it</p> <p>spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: `it doesn't</p> <p>seem to dry me at all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I</p> <p>move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more</p> <p>energetic remedies--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak English!' said the Eaglet. `I don't know the meaning of</p> <p>half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do</p> <p>either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:</p> <p>some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p> <p></p> <p> `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,</p> <p>`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much</p> <p>to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY</p> <p>ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'</p> <p>(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter</p> <p>day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p> <p></p> <p> First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the</p> <p>exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party</p> <p>were placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One,</p> <p>two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,</p> <p>and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know</p> <p>when the race was over. However, when they had been running half</p> <p>an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called</p> <p>out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,</p> <p>and asking, `But who has won?'</p> <p></p> <p> This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of</p> <p>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon</p> <p>its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,</p> <p>in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At</p> <p>last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have</p> <p>prizes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices</p> <p>asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with</p> <p>one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,</p> <p>calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand</p> <p>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt</p> <p>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</p> <p>There was exactly one a-piece all round.</p> <p></p> <p> `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have</p> <p>you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.</p> <p></p> <p> Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo</p> <p>solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of</p> <p>this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short</p> <p>speech, they all cheered.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked</p> <p>so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not</p> <p>think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,</p> <p>looking as solemn as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise</p> <p>and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not</p> <p>taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on</p> <p>the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again</p> <p>in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p> <p></p> <p> `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,</p> <p>`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half</p> <p>afraid that it would be offended again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to</p> <p>Alice, and sighing.</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with</p> <p>wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And</p> <p>she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so</p> <p>that her idea of the tale was something like this:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Fury said to a</p> <p> mouse, That he</p> <p> met in the</p> <p> house,</p> <p> "Let us</p> <p> both go to</p> <p> law: I will</p> <p> prosecute</p> <p> YOU. --Come,</p> <p> I'll take no</p> <p> denial; We</p> <p> must have a</p> <p> trial: For</p> <p> really this</p> <p> morning I've</p> <p> nothing</p> <p> to do."</p> <p> Said the</p> <p> mouse to the</p> <p> cur, "Such</p> <p> a trial,</p> <p> dear Sir,</p> <p> With</p> <p> no jury</p> <p> or judge,</p> <p> would be</p> <p> wasting</p> <p> our</p> <p> breath."</p> <p> "I'll be</p> <p> judge, I'll</p> <p> be jury,"</p> <p> Said</p> <p> cunning</p> <p> old Fury:</p> <p> "I'll</p> <p> try the</p> <p> whole</p> <p> cause,</p> <p> and</p> <p> condemn</p> <p> you</p> <p> to</p> <p> death."'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.</p> <p>`What are you thinking of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to</p> <p>the fifth bend, I think?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up</p> <p>and walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily</p> <p>offended, you know!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse only growled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after</p> <p>it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but</p> <p>the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little</p> <p>quicker.</p> <p></p> <p> `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it</p> <p>was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of</p> <p>saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you</p> <p>never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the</p> <p>young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the</p> <p>patience of an oyster!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,</p> <p>addressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'</p> <p>said the Lory.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about</p> <p>her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for</p> <p>catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her</p> <p>after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look</p> <p>at it!'</p> <p></p> <p> This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</p> <p>Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began</p> <p>wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be</p> <p>getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary</p> <p>called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my</p> <p>dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts</p> <p>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a</p> <p>melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm</p> <p>sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I</p> <p>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice</p> <p>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</p> <p>In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of</p> <p>footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping</p> <p>that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to</p> <p>finish his story.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IV</p> <p></p> <p> The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;</p> <p>and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!</p> <p>Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me</p> <p>executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have</p> <p>dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was</p> <p>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she</p> <p>very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were</p> <p>nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her</p> <p>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and</p> <p>the little door, had vanished completely.</p> <p></p> <p> Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,</p> <p>and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE</p> <p>you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of</p> <p>gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened</p> <p>that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without</p> <p>trying to explain the mistake it had made.</p> <p></p> <p> `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.</p> <p>`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd</p> <p>better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'</p> <p>As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door</p> <p>of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'</p> <p>engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried</p> <p>upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,</p> <p>and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and</p> <p>gloves.</p> <p></p> <p> `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going</p> <p>messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on</p> <p>messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that</p> <p>would happen: `"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready</p> <p>for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see</p> <p>that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went</p> <p>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering</p> <p>people about like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with</p> <p>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two</p> <p>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and</p> <p>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when</p> <p>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-</p> <p>glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'</p> <p>but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know</p> <p>SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,</p> <p>`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this</p> <p>bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for</p> <p>really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'</p> <p></p> <p> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:</p> <p>before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing</p> <p>against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being</p> <p>broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself</p> <p>`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I</p> <p>can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so</p> <p>much!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and</p> <p>growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in</p> <p>another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried</p> <p>the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the</p> <p>other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,</p> <p>as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one</p> <p>foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,</p> <p>whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'</p> <p></p> <p> Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full</p> <p>effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,</p> <p>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting</p> <p>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one</p> <p>wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about</p> <p>by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that</p> <p>rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,</p> <p>this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!</p> <p>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing</p> <p>never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There</p> <p>ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when</p> <p>I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more</p> <p>HERE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I</p> <p>am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--</p> <p>but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you</p> <p>learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no</p> <p>room at all for any lesson-books!'</p> <p></p> <p> And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,</p> <p>and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few</p> <p>minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves</p> <p>this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the</p> <p>stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and</p> <p>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she</p> <p>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no</p> <p>reason to be afraid of it.</p> <p></p> <p> Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;</p> <p>but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed</p> <p>hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it</p> <p>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she</p> <p>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly</p> <p>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not</p> <p>get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,</p> <p>and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was</p> <p>just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something</p> <p>of the sort.</p> <p></p> <p> Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are</p> <p>you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then</p> <p>I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!</p> <p>Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')</p> <p></p> <p> `An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it</p> <p>fills the whole window!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it</p> <p>away!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear</p> <p>whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer</p> <p>honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at</p> <p>last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in</p> <p>the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more</p> <p>sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there</p> <p>must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for</p> <p>pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I</p> <p>don't want to stay in here any longer!'</p> <p></p> <p> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at</p> <p>last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a</p> <p>good many voices all talking together: she made out the words:</p> <p>`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;</p> <p>Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up</p> <p>at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half</p> <p>high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--</p> <p>Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind</p> <p>that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud</p> <p>crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go</p> <p>down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,</p> <p>then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to</p> <p>go down the chimney!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said</p> <p>Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!</p> <p>I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is</p> <p>narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'</p> <p></p> <p> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and</p> <p>waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what</p> <p>sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close</p> <p>above her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one</p> <p>sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes</p> <p>Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the</p> <p>hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold</p> <p>up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?</p> <p>What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'</p> <p></p> <p> Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'</p> <p>thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm</p> <p>better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know</p> <p>is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes</p> <p>like a sky-rocket!'</p> <p></p> <p> `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and</p> <p>Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do. I'll set</p> <p>Dinah at you!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to</p> <p>herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any</p> <p>sense, they'd take the roof off.' After a minute or two, they</p> <p>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A</p> <p>barrowful will do, to begin with.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to</p> <p>doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came</p> <p>rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.</p> <p>`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,</p> <p>`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead</p> <p>silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all</p> <p>turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright</p> <p>idea came into her head. `If I eat one of these cakes,' she</p> <p>thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it</p> <p>can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I</p> <p>suppose.'</p> <p></p> <p> So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find</p> <p>that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small</p> <p>enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and</p> <p>found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.</p> <p>The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by</p> <p>two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.</p> <p>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she</p> <p>ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a</p> <p>thick wood.</p> <p></p> <p> `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she</p> <p>wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;</p> <p>and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</p> <p>I think that will be the best plan.'</p> <p></p> <p> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and</p> <p>simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the</p> <p>smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering</p> <p>about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over</p> <p>her head made her look up in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round</p> <p>eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</p> <p>`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried</p> <p>hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the</p> <p>time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it</p> <p>would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</p> <p></p> <p> Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of</p> <p>stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped</p> <p>into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,</p> <p>and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice</p> <p>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run</p> <p>over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy</p> <p>made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in</p> <p>its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very</p> <p>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every</p> <p>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle</p> <p>again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the</p> <p>stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long</p> <p>way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat</p> <p>down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its</p> <p>mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p> <p></p> <p> This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;</p> <p>so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out</p> <p>of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the</p> <p>distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she</p> <p>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself</p> <p>with one of the leaves: `I should have liked teaching it tricks</p> <p>very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh</p> <p>dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let</p> <p>me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or</p> <p>drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'</p> <p></p> <p> The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round</p> <p>her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see</p> <p>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under</p> <p>the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,</p> <p>about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under</p> <p>it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her</p> <p>that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.</p> <p></p> <p> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of</p> <p>the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large</p> <p>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,</p> <p>quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice</p> <p>of her or of anything else.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER V</p> <p></p> <p> Advice from a Caterpillar</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in</p> <p>silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice</p> <p>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--</p> <p>at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think</p> <p>I must have been changed several times since then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</p> <p>`Explain yourself!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because</p> <p>I'm not myself, you see.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very</p> <p>politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and</p> <p>being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but</p> <p>when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you</p> <p>know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll</p> <p>feel it a little queer, won't you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;</p> <p>`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. `Who are YOU?'</p> <p></p> <p> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the</p> <p>conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's</p> <p>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,</p> <p>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not</p> <p>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in</p> <p>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. `I've something</p> <p>important to say!'</p> <p></p> <p> This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as</p> <p>she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else</p> <p>to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth</p> <p>hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but</p> <p>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth</p> <p>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as</p> <p>I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it</p> <p>all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice folded her hands, and began:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,</p> <p> `And your hair has become very white;</p> <p> And yet you incessantly stand on your head--</p> <p> Do you think, at your age, it is right?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,</p> <p> `I feared it might injure the brain;</p> <p> But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,</p> <p> Why, I do it again and again.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,</p> <p> And have grown most uncommonly fat;</p> <p> Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--</p> <p> Pray, what is the reason of that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</p> <p> `I kept all my limbs very supple</p> <p> By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--</p> <p> Allow me to sell you a couple?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak</p> <p> For anything tougher than suet;</p> <p> Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--</p> <p> Pray how did you manage to do it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,</p> <p> And argued each case with my wife;</p> <p> And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,</p> <p> Has lasted the rest of my life.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose</p> <p> That your eye was as steady as ever;</p> <p> Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--</p> <p> What made you so awfully clever?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'</p> <p> Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!</p> <p> Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?</p> <p> Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the</p> <p>words have got altered.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.</p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar was the first to speak.</p> <p></p> <p> `What size do you want to be?' it asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;</p> <p>`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in</p> <p>her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you</p> <p>wouldn't mind,' said Alice: `three inches is such a wretched</p> <p>height to be.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three</p> <p>inches high).</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</p> <p>And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so</p> <p>easily offended!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it</p> <p>put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</p> <p></p> <p> This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</p> <p>In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got</p> <p>down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely</p> <p>remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and</p> <p>the other side will make you grow shorter.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had</p> <p>asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a</p> <p>minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as</p> <p>it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</p> <p>However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they</p> <p>would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p> <p></p> <p> `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a</p> <p>little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment</p> <p>she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her</p> <p>foot!</p> <p></p> <p> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but</p> <p>she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking</p> <p>rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.</p> <p>Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was</p> <p>hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and</p> <p>managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of</p> <p>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she</p> <p>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could</p> <p>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which</p> <p>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay</p> <p>far below her.</p> <p></p> <p> `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. `And where</p> <p>HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I</p> <p>can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no</p> <p>result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the</p> <p>distant green leaves.</p> <p></p> <p> As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her</p> <p>head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted</p> <p>to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,</p> <p>like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a</p> <p>graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which</p> <p>she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she</p> <p>had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a</p> <p>hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating</p> <p>her violently with its wings.</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. `Let me alone!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more</p> <p>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every</p> <p>way, and nothing seems to suit them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've</p> <p>tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but</p> <p>those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no</p> <p>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</p> <p></p> <p> `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the</p> <p>Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and</p> <p>day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was</p> <p>beginning to see its meaning.</p> <p></p> <p> `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued</p> <p>the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was</p> <p>thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come</p> <p>wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. `I'm a--I'm</p> <p>a--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're</p> <p>trying to invent something!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she</p> <p>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the</p> <p>deepest contempt. `I've seen a good many little girls in my</p> <p>time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a</p> <p>serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be</p> <p>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very</p> <p>truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as</p> <p>serpents do, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why</p> <p>then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent</p> <p>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of</p> <p>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and</p> <p>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a</p> <p>serpent?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm</p> <p>not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't</p> <p>want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it</p> <p>settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the</p> <p>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled</p> <p>among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and</p> <p>untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the</p> <p>pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very</p> <p>carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and</p> <p>growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had</p> <p>succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p> <p></p> <p> It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,</p> <p>that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a</p> <p>few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come,</p> <p>there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes</p> <p>are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to</p> <p>another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next</p> <p>thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be</p> <p>done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an</p> <p>open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</p> <p>`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come</p> <p>upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their</p> <p>wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did</p> <p>not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself</p> <p>down to nine inches high.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VI</p> <p></p> <p> Pig and Pepper</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and</p> <p>wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came</p> <p>running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman</p> <p>because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only,</p> <p>she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door</p> <p>with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,</p> <p>with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,</p> <p>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their</p> <p>heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and</p> <p>crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great</p> <p>letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to</p> <p>the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess. An</p> <p>invitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman</p> <p>repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the</p> <p>words a little, `From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess</p> <p>to play croquet.'</p> <p></p> <p> Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled</p> <p>together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into</p> <p>the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped</p> <p>out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the</p> <p>ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and</p> <p>that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the</p> <p>door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise</p> <p>inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was</p> <p>a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling</p> <p>and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish</p> <p>or kettle had been broken to pieces.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'</p> <p></p> <p> `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went</p> <p>on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us. For</p> <p>instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let</p> <p>you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time</p> <p>he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. `But</p> <p>perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so</p> <p>VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might</p> <p>answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate</p> <p>came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just</p> <p>grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees</p> <p>behind him.</p> <p></p> <p> `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,</p> <p>exactly as if nothing had happened.</p> <p></p> <p> `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. `That's the</p> <p>first question, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.</p> <p>`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the</p> <p>creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for</p> <p>repeating his remark, with variations. `I shall sit here,' he</p> <p>said, `on and off, for days and days.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what am I to do?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:</p> <p>`he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.</p> <p></p> <p> The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of</p> <p>smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a</p> <p>three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was</p> <p>leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to</p> <p>be full of soup.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to</p> <p>herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p> <p></p> <p> There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the</p> <p>Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was</p> <p>sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The</p> <p>only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,</p> <p>and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from</p> <p>ear to ear.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for</p> <p>she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to</p> <p>speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!'</p> <p></p> <p> She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice</p> <p>quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed</p> <p>to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I</p> <p>didn't know that cats COULD grin.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,</p> <p>feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</p> <p></p> <p> `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought</p> <p>it would be as well to introduce some other subject of</p> <p>conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took</p> <p>the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work</p> <p>throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby</p> <p>--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,</p> <p>plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when</p> <p>they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it</p> <p>was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up</p> <p>and down in an agony of terror. `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS</p> <p>nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very</p> <p>nearly carried it off.</p> <p></p> <p> `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a</p> <p>hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it</p> <p>does.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very</p> <p>glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her</p> <p>knowledge. `Just think of what work it would make with the day</p> <p>and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn</p> <p>round on its axis--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant</p> <p>to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and</p> <p>seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: `Twenty-four</p> <p>hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide</p> <p>figures!' And with that she began nursing her child again,</p> <p>singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a</p> <p>violent shake at the end of every line:</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak roughly to your little boy,</p> <p> And beat him when he sneezes:</p> <p> He only does it to annoy,</p> <p> Because he knows it teases.'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> (In which the cook and the baby joined):--</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept</p> <p>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing</p> <p>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I speak severely to my boy,</p> <p> I beat him when he sneezes;</p> <p> For he can thoroughly enjoy</p> <p> The pepper when he pleases!'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said</p> <p>to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. `I must go and</p> <p>get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of</p> <p>the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,</p> <p>but it just missed her.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-</p> <p>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all</p> <p>directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor</p> <p>little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,</p> <p>and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,</p> <p>so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much</p> <p>as she could do to hold it.</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,</p> <p>(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep</p> <p>tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its</p> <p>undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. `IF I</p> <p>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure</p> <p>to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it</p> <p>behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing</p> <p>grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). `Don't</p> <p>grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing</p> <p>yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into</p> <p>its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no</p> <p>doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout</p> <p>than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for</p> <p>a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at</p> <p>all. `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked</p> <p>into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</p> <p></p> <p> No, there were no tears. `If you're going to turn into a pig,</p> <p>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do</p> <p>with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or</p> <p>grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for</p> <p>some while in silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I</p> <p>to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted</p> <p>again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some</p> <p>alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was</p> <p>neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be</p> <p>quite absurd for her to carry it further.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to</p> <p>see it trot away quietly into the wood. `If it had grown up,'</p> <p>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:</p> <p>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began</p> <p>thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as</p> <p>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right</p> <p>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing</p> <p>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-</p> <p>natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great</p> <p>many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p> <p></p> <p> `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at</p> <p>all know whether it would like the name: however, it only</p> <p>grinned a little wider. `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought</p> <p>Alice, and she went on. `Would you tell me, please, which way I</p> <p>ought to go from here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said</p> <p>the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't much care where--' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk</p> <p>long enough.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another</p> <p>question. `What sort of people live about here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,</p> <p>`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,</p> <p>`lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.</p> <p>I'm mad. You're mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on</p> <p>`And how do you know that you're mad?'</p> <p></p> <p> `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad. You grant</p> <p>that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I suppose so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's</p> <p>angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm</p> <p>pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call it what you like,' said the Cat. `Do you play croquet</p> <p>with the Queen to-day?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been</p> <p>invited yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used</p> <p>to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place</p> <p>where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.</p> <p></p> <p> `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. `I'd</p> <p>nearly forgotten to ask.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had</p> <p>come back in a natural way.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it</p> <p>did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the</p> <p>direction in which the March Hare was said to live. `I've seen</p> <p>hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be</p> <p>much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be</p> <p>raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.' As she said</p> <p>this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a</p> <p>branch of a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep</p> <p>appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'</p> <p></p> <p> `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,</p> <p>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,</p> <p>which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever</p> <p>saw in my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the</p> <p>house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house,</p> <p>because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was</p> <p>thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not</p> <p>like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand</p> <p>bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even</p> <p>then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself</p> <p>`Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd</p> <p>gone to see the Hatter instead!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VII</p> <p></p> <p> A Mad Tea-Party</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,</p> <p>and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a</p> <p>Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two</p> <p>were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking</p> <p>over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p> <p></p> <p> The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded</p> <p>together at one corner of it: `No room! No room!' they cried</p> <p>out when they saw Alice coming. `There's PLENTY of room!' said</p> <p>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one</p> <p>end of the table.</p> <p></p> <p> `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it</p> <p>but tea. `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice</p> <p>angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being</p> <p>invited,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a</p> <p>great many more than three.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been</p> <p>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was</p> <p>his first speech.</p> <p></p> <p> `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said</p> <p>with some severity; `it's very rude.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all</p> <p>he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. `I'm glad</p> <p>they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she</p> <p>added aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'</p> <p>said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what</p> <p>I say--that's the same thing, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. `You might just</p> <p>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat</p> <p>what I see"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I</p> <p>like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to</p> <p>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the</p> <p>same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the</p> <p>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,</p> <p>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and</p> <p>writing-desks, which wasn't much.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter was the first to break the silence. `What day of</p> <p>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his</p> <p>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking</p> <p>it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. `I told you butter</p> <p>wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March</p> <p>Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter</p> <p>grumbled: `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'</p> <p></p> <p> The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then</p> <p>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he</p> <p>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It</p> <p>was the BEST butter, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</p> <p>`What a funny watch!' she remarked. `It tells the day of the</p> <p>month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. `Does YOUR watch tell</p> <p>you what year it is?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: `but that's</p> <p>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to</p> <p>have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</p> <p>`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she</p> <p>could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured</p> <p>a little hot tea upon its nose.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without</p> <p>opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to</p> <p>remark myself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to</p> <p>Alice again.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I give it up,' Alice replied: `what's the answer?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nor I,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice sighed wearily. `I think you might do something better</p> <p>with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that</p> <p>have no answers.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you</p> <p>wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head</p> <p>contemptuously. `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: `but I know I have to</p> <p>beat time when I learn music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. `He won't stand</p> <p>beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do</p> <p>almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose</p> <p>it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:</p> <p>you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the</p> <p>clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'</p> <p></p> <p> (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a</p> <p>whisper.)</p> <p></p> <p> `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:</p> <p>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: `but you could keep</p> <p>it to half-past one as long as you liked.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter shook his head mournfully. `Not I!' he replied.</p> <p>`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'</p> <p>(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the</p> <p>great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing</p> <p></p> <p> "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</p> <p> How I wonder what you're at!"</p> <p></p> <p>You know the song, perhaps?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--</p> <p></p> <p> "Up above the world you fly,</p> <p> Like a tea-tray in the sky.</p> <p> Twinkle, twinkle--"'</p> <p></p> <p>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep</p> <p>`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that</p> <p>they had to pinch it to make it stop.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,</p> <p>`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the</p> <p>time! Off with his head!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,</p> <p>`he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'</p> <p></p> <p> A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so</p> <p>many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always</p> <p>tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice</p> <p>ventured to ask.</p> <p></p> <p> `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,</p> <p>yawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady</p> <p>tells us a story.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at</p> <p>the proposal.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. `Wake up,</p> <p>Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. `I wasn't asleep,' he</p> <p>said in a hoarse, feeble voice: `I heard every word you fellows</p> <p>were saying.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep</p> <p>again before it's done.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the</p> <p>Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,</p> <p>Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great</p> <p>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</p> <p></p> <p> `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a</p> <p>minute or two.</p> <p></p> <p> `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently</p> <p>remarked; `they'd have been ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways</p> <p>of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went</p> <p>on: `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very</p> <p>earnestly.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so</p> <p>I can't take more.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very</p> <p>easy to take MORE than nothing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked</p> <p>triumphantly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped</p> <p>herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the</p> <p>Dormouse, and repeated her question. `Why did they live at the</p> <p>bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and</p> <p>then said, `It was a treacle-well.'</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but</p> <p>the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse</p> <p>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the</p> <p>story for yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt</p> <p>again. I dare say there may be ONE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he</p> <p>consented to go on. `And so these three little sisters--they</p> <p>were learning to draw, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this</p> <p>time.</p> <p></p> <p> `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: `let's all move</p> <p>one place on.'</p> <p></p> <p> He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the</p> <p>March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather</p> <p>unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the</p> <p>only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a</p> <p>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset</p> <p>the milk-jug into his plate.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began</p> <p>very cautiously: `But I don't understand. Where did they draw</p> <p>the treacle from?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so</p> <p>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,</p> <p>stupid?'</p> <p></p> <p> `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not</p> <p>choosing to notice this last remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'</p> <p></p> <p> This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse</p> <p>go on for some time without interrupting it.</p> <p></p> <p> `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and</p> <p>rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew</p> <p>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why with an M?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why not?' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going</p> <p>off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up</p> <p>again with a little shriek, and went on: `--that begins with an</p> <p>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--</p> <p>you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever</p> <p>see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I</p> <p>don't think--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got</p> <p>up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep</p> <p>instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her</p> <p>going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that</p> <p>they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were</p> <p>trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</p> <p></p> <p> `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she</p> <p>picked her way through the wood. `It's the stupidest tea-party I</p> <p>ever was at in all my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a</p> <p>door leading right into it. `That's very curious!' she thought.</p> <p>`But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.'</p> <p>And in she went.</p> <p></p> <p> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the</p> <p>little glass table. `Now, I'll manage better this time,'</p> <p>she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,</p> <p>and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went</p> <p>to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it</p> <p>in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down</p> <p>the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the</p> <p>beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VIII</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's Croquet-Ground</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the</p> <p>roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at</p> <p>it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious</p> <p>thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up</p> <p>to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go</p> <p>splashing paint over me like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged</p> <p>my elbow.'</p> <p></p> <p> On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always</p> <p>lay the blame on others!'</p> <p></p> <p> `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. `I heard the Queen say only</p> <p>yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it</p> <p>was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'</p> <p></p> <p> Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all</p> <p>the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as</p> <p>she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the</p> <p>others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are</p> <p>painting those roses?'</p> <p></p> <p> Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a</p> <p>low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to</p> <p>have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;</p> <p>and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads</p> <p>cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore</p> <p>she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously</p> <p>looking across the garden, called out `The Queen! The Queen!'</p> <p>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon</p> <p>their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice</p> <p>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped</p> <p>like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and</p> <p>feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were</p> <p>ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the</p> <p>soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were</p> <p>ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand</p> <p>in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next</p> <p>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice</p> <p>recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous</p> <p>manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without</p> <p>noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the</p> <p>King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this</p> <p>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on</p> <p>her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember</p> <p>ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,</p> <p>what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people</p> <p>had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'</p> <p>So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p> <p></p> <p> When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped</p> <p>and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'</p> <p>She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,</p> <p>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'</p> <p></p> <p> `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very</p> <p>politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of</p> <p>cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three</p> <p>gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as</p> <p>they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs</p> <p>was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether</p> <p>they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her</p> <p>own children.</p> <p></p> <p> `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</p> <p>`It's no business of MINE.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her</p> <p>for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!</p> <p>Off--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the</p> <p>Queen was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said</p> <p>`Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave</p> <p>`Turn them over!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p> <p></p> <p> `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the</p> <p>three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the</p> <p>King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</p> <p></p> <p> `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. `You make me giddy.'</p> <p>And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you</p> <p>been doing here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,</p> <p>going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the</p> <p>roses. `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,</p> <p>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate</p> <p>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</p> <p></p> <p> `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a</p> <p>large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered</p> <p>about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly</p> <p>marched off after the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers</p> <p>shouted in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's right!' shouted the Queen. `Can you play croquet?'</p> <p></p> <p> The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question</p> <p>was evidently meant for her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes!' shouted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the</p> <p>procession, wondering very much what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.</p> <p>She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously</p> <p>into her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very,' said Alice: `--where's the Duchess?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He</p> <p>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised</p> <p>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and</p> <p>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I didn't,' said Alice: `I don't think it's at all a pity.</p> <p>I said "What for?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a</p> <p>little scream of laughter. `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a</p> <p>frightened tone. `The Queen will hear you! You see, she came</p> <p>rather late, and the Queen said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,</p> <p>and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up</p> <p>against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or</p> <p>two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a</p> <p>curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and</p> <p>furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live</p> <p>flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to</p> <p>stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p> <p></p> <p> The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her</p> <p>flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,</p> <p>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,</p> <p>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened</p> <p>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it</p> <p>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a</p> <p>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:</p> <p>and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,</p> <p>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled</p> <p>itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,</p> <p>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she</p> <p>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers</p> <p>were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the</p> <p>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very</p> <p>difficult game indeed.</p> <p></p> <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns,</p> <p>quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in</p> <p>a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went</p> <p>stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with</p> <p>her head!' about once in a minute.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as</p> <p>yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might</p> <p>happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of</p> <p>me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great</p> <p>wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'</p> <p></p> <p> She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering</p> <p>whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a</p> <p>curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at</p> <p>first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to</p> <p>be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat: now I</p> <p>shall have somebody to talk to.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was</p> <p>mouth enough for it to speak with.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. `It's no</p> <p>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at</p> <p>least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared,</p> <p>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the</p> <p>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The</p> <p>Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and</p> <p>no more of it appeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather</p> <p>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't</p> <p>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in</p> <p>particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and</p> <p>you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;</p> <p>for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next</p> <p>walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have</p> <p>croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it</p> <p>saw mine coming!'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at all,' said Alice: `she's so extremely--' Just then</p> <p>she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so</p> <p>she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while</p> <p>finishing the game.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen smiled and passed on.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and</p> <p>looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: `allow me</p> <p>to introduce it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:</p> <p>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me</p> <p>like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. `I've read that in</p> <p>some book, but I don't remember where.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and</p> <p>he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear! I</p> <p>wish you would have this cat removed!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great</p> <p>or small. `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking</p> <p>round.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and</p> <p>he hurried off.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game</p> <p>was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,</p> <p>screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three</p> <p>of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and</p> <p>she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in</p> <p>such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or</p> <p>not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p> <p></p> <p> The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,</p> <p>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one</p> <p>of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her</p> <p>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where</p> <p>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up</p> <p>into a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,</p> <p>the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:</p> <p>`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches</p> <p>are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away</p> <p>under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for</p> <p>a little more conversation with her friend.</p> <p></p> <p> When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to</p> <p>find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute</p> <p>going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who</p> <p>were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,</p> <p>and looked very uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to</p> <p>settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,</p> <p>though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed</p> <p>to make out exactly what they said.</p> <p></p> <p> The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a</p> <p>head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had</p> <p>never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin</p> <p>at HIS time of life.</p> <p></p> <p> The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be</p> <p>beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about</p> <p>it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.</p> <p>(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so</p> <p>grave and anxious.)</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the</p> <p>Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: `fetch</p> <p>her here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,</p> <p>by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely</p> <p>disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down</p> <p>looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IX</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle's Story</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old</p> <p>thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately</p> <p>into Alice's, and they walked off together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and</p> <p>thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had</p> <p>made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p> `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very</p> <p>hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT</p> <p>ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that</p> <p>makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at</p> <p>having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them</p> <p>sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar</p> <p>and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish</p> <p>people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you</p> <p>know--'</p> <p></p> <p> She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a</p> <p>little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</p> <p>`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you</p> <p>forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that</p> <p>is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. `Everything's got a</p> <p>moral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up</p> <p>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first,</p> <p>because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was</p> <p>exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,</p> <p>and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not</p> <p>like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of</p> <p>keeping up the conversation a little.</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis so,' said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--"Oh,</p> <p>'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody</p> <p>minding their own business!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,</p> <p>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,</p> <p>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the</p> <p>sounds will take care of themselves."'</p> <p></p> <p> `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your</p> <p>waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I'm</p> <p>doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the</p> <p>experiment?'</p> <p></p> <p> `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all</p> <p>anxious to have the experiment tried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very true,' said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both</p> <p>bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock</p> <p>together."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: `what a clear way you</p> <p>have of putting things!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree</p> <p>to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near</p> <p>here. And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the</p> <p>less there is of yours."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this</p> <p>last remark, `it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it</p> <p>is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of</p> <p>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put</p> <p>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than</p> <p>what it might appear to others that what you were or might have</p> <p>been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared</p> <p>to them to be otherwise."'</p> <p></p> <p> `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very</p> <p>politely, `if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it</p> <p>as you say it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess</p> <p>replied, in a pleased tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'</p> <p>said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. `I make you</p> <p>a present of everything I've said as yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. `I'm glad they don't</p> <p>give birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to</p> <p>say it out loud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her</p> <p>sharp little chin.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was</p> <p>beginning to feel a little worried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;</p> <p>and the m--'</p> <p></p> <p> But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died</p> <p>away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the</p> <p>arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up,</p> <p>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,</p> <p>frowning like a thunderstorm.</p> <p></p> <p> `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on</p> <p>the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,</p> <p>and that in about half no time! Take your choice!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p> <p></p> <p> `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice</p> <p>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her</p> <p>back to the croquet-ground.</p> <p></p> <p> The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,</p> <p>and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her,</p> <p>they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a</p> <p>moment's delay would cost them their lives.</p> <p></p> <p> All the time they were playing the Queen never left off</p> <p>quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his</p> <p>head!' or `Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were</p> <p>taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave</p> <p>off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour</p> <p>or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the</p> <p>King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of</p> <p>execution.</p> <p></p> <p> Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to</p> <p>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said Alice. `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his</p> <p>history,'</p> <p></p> <p> As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low</p> <p>voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.' `Come,</p> <p>THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite</p> <p>unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p> <p></p> <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the</p> <p>sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)</p> <p>`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to</p> <p>see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and</p> <p>see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,</p> <p>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like</p> <p>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would</p> <p>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage</p> <p>Queen: so she waited.</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the</p> <p>Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!'</p> <p>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the fun?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. `It's all her fancy, that: they</p> <p>never executes nobody, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went</p> <p>slowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life,</p> <p>never!'</p> <p></p> <p> They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the</p> <p>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,</p> <p>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart</p> <p>would break. She pitied him deeply. `What is his sorrow?' she</p> <p>asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the</p> <p>same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got</p> <p>no sorrow, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with</p> <p>large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to</p> <p>know your history, she do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow</p> <p>tone: `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've</p> <p>finished.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice</p> <p>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he</p> <p>doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.</p> <p></p> <p> `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was</p> <p>a real Turtle.'</p> <p></p> <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only</p> <p>by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and</p> <p>the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very</p> <p>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your</p> <p>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be</p> <p>more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more</p> <p>calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to</p> <p>school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call</p> <p>him Tortoise--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle angrily: `really you are very dull!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple</p> <p>question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and</p> <p>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At</p> <p>last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!</p> <p>Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe</p> <p>it--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak</p> <p>again. The Mock Turtle went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school</p> <p>every day--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be</p> <p>so proud as all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle in a tone of great relief. `Now at OURS they had at the</p> <p>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'</p> <p></p> <p> `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the</p> <p>bottom of the sea.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a</p> <p>sigh. `I only took the regular course.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was that?' inquired Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock</p> <p>Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--</p> <p>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. `What is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. `What! Never</p> <p>heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. `You know what to beautify is,</p> <p>I suppose?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to</p> <p>uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about</p> <p>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you</p> <p>to learn?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting</p> <p>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,</p> <p>with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old</p> <p>conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us</p> <p>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was THAT like?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: `I'm</p> <p>too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics</p> <p>master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he</p> <p>taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;</p> <p>and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a</p> <p>hurry to change the subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the</p> <p>next, and so on.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon</p> <p>remarked: `because they lessen from day to day.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a</p> <p>little before she made her next remark. `Then the eleventh day</p> <p>must have been a holiday?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a</p> <p>very decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER X</p> <p></p> <p> The Lobster Quadrille</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper</p> <p>across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for</p> <p>a minute or two sobs choked his voice. `Same as if he had a bone</p> <p>in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him</p> <p>and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered</p> <p>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--</p> <p>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'</p> <p>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,</p> <p>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful</p> <p>thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, indeed,' said Alice. `What sort of a dance is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;</p> <p>then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `--you advance twice--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: `advance twice, set to</p> <p>partners--'</p> <p></p> <p> `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the</p> <p>Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</p> <p></p> <p> `--as far out to sea as you can--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,</p> <p>capering wildly about.</p> <p></p> <p> `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the</p> <p>Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,</p> <p>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat</p> <p>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very much indeed,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the</p> <p>Gryphon. `We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall</p> <p>sing?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. `I've forgotten the words.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now</p> <p>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and</p> <p>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle</p> <p>sang this, very slowly and sadly:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>`"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.</p> <p>"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my</p> <p> tail.</p> <p>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</p> <p>They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be</p> <p>When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to</p> <p> sea!"</p> <p>But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look</p> <p> askance--</p> <p>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the</p> <p> dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p></p> <p>`"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.</p> <p>"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.</p> <p>The further off from England the nearer is to France--</p> <p>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</p> <p></p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p> dance?</p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p> dance?"'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said</p> <p>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: `and I do so</p> <p>like that curious song about the whiting!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've</p> <p>seen them, of course?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she</p> <p>checked herself hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but</p> <p>if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're</p> <p>like.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. `They have their</p> <p>tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:</p> <p>`crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails</p> <p>in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle</p> <p>yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all</p> <p>that,' he said to the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with</p> <p>the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So</p> <p>they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in</p> <p>their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting. I never knew</p> <p>so much about a whiting before.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the</p> <p>Gryphon. `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never thought about it,' said Alice. `Why?'</p> <p></p> <p> `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very</p> <p>solemnly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was thoroughly puzzled. `Does the boots and shoes!' she</p> <p>repeated in a wondering tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. `I</p> <p>mean, what makes them so shiny?'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she</p> <p>gave her answer. `They're done with blacking, I believe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep</p> <p>voice, `are done with a whiting. Now you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great</p> <p>curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather</p> <p>impatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were</p> <p>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep</p> <p>back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>said: `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came</p> <p>to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With</p> <p>what porpoise?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended</p> <p>tone. And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR</p> <p>adventures.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'</p> <p>said Alice a little timidly: `but it's no use going back to</p> <p>yesterday, because I was a different person then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an</p> <p>impatient tone: `explanations take such a dreadful time.'</p> <p></p> <p> So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when</p> <p>she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about</p> <p>it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on</p> <p>each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she</p> <p>gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly</p> <p>quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,</p> <p>FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming</p> <p>different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said</p> <p>`That's very curious.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated</p> <p>thoughtfully. `I should like to hear her try and repeat</p> <p>something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as</p> <p>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said</p> <p>the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat</p> <p>lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'</p> <p>However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so</p> <p>full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was</p> <p>saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,</p> <p> "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."</p> <p> As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose</p> <p> Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,</p> <p> And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,</p> <p> But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,</p> <p> His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]</p> <p></p> <p> `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'</p> <p>said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it</p> <p>sounds uncommon nonsense.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her</p> <p>hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. `Go on with</p> <p>the next verse.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. `How COULD</p> <p>he turn them out with his nose, you know?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was</p> <p>dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the</p> <p>subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:</p> <p>`it begins "I passed by his garden."'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would</p> <p>all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,</p> <p> How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,</p> <p> While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</p> <p> When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,</p> <p> Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:</p> <p> While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,</p> <p> And concluded the banquet--]</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far</p> <p>the most confusing thing I ever heard!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and</p> <p>Alice was only too glad to do so.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the</p> <p>Gryphon went on. `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you</p> <p>a song?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'</p> <p>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather</p> <p>offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her</p> <p>"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes</p> <p>choked with sobs, to sing this:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</p> <p> Waiting in a hot tureen!</p> <p> Who for such dainties would not stoop?</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,</p> <p> Game, or any other dish?</p> <p> Who would not give all else for two</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had</p> <p>just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'</p> <p>was heard in the distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,</p> <p>it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</p> <p></p> <p> `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon</p> <p>only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more</p> <p>faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the</p> <p>melancholy words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XI</p> <p></p> <p> Who Stole the Tarts?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when</p> <p>they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts</p> <p>of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:</p> <p>the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on</p> <p>each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,</p> <p>with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the</p> <p>other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large</p> <p>dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice</p> <p>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'</p> <p>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed</p> <p>to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about</p> <p>her, to pass away the time.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had</p> <p>read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that</p> <p>she knew the name of nearly everything there. `That's the</p> <p>judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'</p> <p></p> <p> The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown</p> <p>over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he</p> <p>did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly</p> <p>not becoming.</p> <p></p> <p> `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve</p> <p>creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because</p> <p>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they</p> <p>are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over</p> <p>to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and</p> <p>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the</p> <p>meaning of it at all. However, `jury-men' would have done just</p> <p>as well.</p> <p></p> <p> The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</p> <p>`What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. `They</p> <p>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in</p> <p>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the</p> <p>trial.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but</p> <p>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in</p> <p>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked</p> <p>anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their</p> <p>shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'</p> <p>on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them</p> <p>didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his</p> <p>neighbour to tell him. `A nice muddle their slates'll be in</p> <p>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,</p> <p>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got</p> <p>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it</p> <p>away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was</p> <p>Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of</p> <p>it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write</p> <p>with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very</p> <p>little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p> <p></p> <p> `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and</p> <p>then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--</p> <p></p> <p> `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,</p> <p> All on a summer day:</p> <p> The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,</p> <p> And took them quite away!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. `There's</p> <p>a great deal to come before that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit</p> <p>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First</p> <p>witness!'</p> <p></p> <p> The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in</p> <p>one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. `I beg</p> <p>pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in: but I</p> <p>hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to have finished,' said the King. `When did you</p> <p>begin?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into</p> <p>the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. `Fourteenth of March, I</p> <p>think it was,' he said.</p> <p></p> <p> `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury</p> <p>eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then</p> <p>added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</p> <p></p> <p> `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who</p> <p>instantly made a memorandum of the fact.</p> <p></p> <p> `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;</p> <p>`I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'</p> <p></p> <p> Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or</p> <p>I'll have you executed on the spot.'</p> <p></p> <p> This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept</p> <p>shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the</p> <p>Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his</p> <p>teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.</p> <p></p> <p> Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which</p> <p>puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was</p> <p>beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she</p> <p>would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she</p> <p>decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for</p> <p>her.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was</p> <p>sitting next to her. `I can hardly breathe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: `I'm growing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: `you know</p> <p>you're growing too.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:</p> <p>`not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily</p> <p>and crossed over to the other side of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to</p> <p>one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the</p> <p>singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter</p> <p>trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have</p> <p>you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a</p> <p>trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week</p> <p>or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and</p> <p>the twinkling of the tea--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.</p> <p>`Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things</p> <p>twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did!' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `I deny it!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `He denies it,' said the King: `leave out that part.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,</p> <p>looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the</p> <p>Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</p> <p></p> <p> `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-</p> <p>and-butter--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you</p> <p>executed.'</p> <p></p> <p> The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,</p> <p>and went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he</p> <p>began.</p> <p></p> <p> `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately</p> <p>suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a</p> <p>hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had</p> <p>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:</p> <p>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat</p> <p>upon it.)</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've so often</p> <p>read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some</p> <p>attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the</p> <p>officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant</p> <p>till now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'</p> <p>continued the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as</p> <p>it is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.</p> <p></p> <p> Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. `Now we</p> <p>shall get on better.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious</p> <p>look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</p> <p></p> <p> `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the</p> <p>court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.</p> <p></p> <p> `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one</p> <p>of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the</p> <p>officer could get to the door.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the next witness!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the</p> <p>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before</p> <p>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began</p> <p>sneezing all at once.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shan't,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a</p> <p>low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy</p> <p>air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till</p> <p>his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What</p> <p>are tarts made of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead that</p> <p>Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch</p> <p>him! Off with his whiskers!'</p> <p></p> <p> For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the</p> <p>Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down</p> <p>again, the cook had disappeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.</p> <p>`Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the</p> <p>Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.</p> <p>It quite makes my forehead ache!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,</p> <p>feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,</p> <p>`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.</p> <p>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top</p> <p>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XII</p> <p></p> <p> Alice's Evidence</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the</p> <p>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she</p> <p>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with</p> <p>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads</p> <p>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding</p> <p>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset</p> <p>the week before.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great</p> <p>dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,</p> <p>for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and</p> <p>she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once</p> <p>and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</p> <p></p> <p> `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave</p> <p>voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--</p> <p>ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as</p> <p>he said do.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she</p> <p>had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing</p> <p>was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable</p> <p>to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that</p> <p>it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it</p> <p>would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of</p> <p>being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and</p> <p>handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write</p> <p>out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed</p> <p>too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,</p> <p>gazing up into the roof of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you know about this business?' the King said to</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.</p> <p>They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when</p> <p>the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,</p> <p>of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and</p> <p>making faces at him as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and</p> <p>went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--</p> <p>unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word</p> <p>sounded best.</p> <p></p> <p> Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some</p> <p>`unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to</p> <p>look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she</p> <p>thought to herself.</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily</p> <p>writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out</p> <p>from his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE</p> <p>HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'</p> <p></p> <p> Everybody looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You are,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides,</p> <p>that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</p> <p>`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said</p> <p>the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has</p> <p>just been picked up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What's in it?' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems</p> <p>to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was</p> <p>written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,</p> <p>there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper</p> <p>as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set</p> <p>of verses.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of</p> <p>the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the</p> <p>queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)</p> <p></p> <p> `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.</p> <p>(The jury all brightened up again.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and</p> <p>they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the</p> <p>matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd</p> <p>have signed your name like an honest man.'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the</p> <p>first really clever thing the King had said that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't</p> <p>even know what they're about!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Read them,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,</p> <p>please your Majesty?' he asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on</p> <p>till you come to the end: then stop.'</p> <p></p> <p> These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--</p> <p></p> <p> `They told me you had been to her,</p> <p> And mentioned me to him:</p> <p> She gave me a good character,</p> <p> But said I could not swim.</p> <p></p> <p> He sent them word I had not gone</p> <p> (We know it to be true):</p> <p> If she should push the matter on,</p> <p> What would become of you?</p> <p></p> <p> I gave her one, they gave him two,</p> <p> You gave us three or more;</p> <p> They all returned from him to you,</p> <p> Though they were mine before.</p> <p></p> <p> If I or she should chance to be</p> <p> Involved in this affair,</p> <p> He trusts to you to set them free,</p> <p> Exactly as we were.</p> <p></p> <p> My notion was that you had been</p> <p> (Before she had this fit)</p> <p> An obstacle that came between</p> <p> Him, and ourselves, and it.</p> <p></p> <p> Don't let him know she liked them best,</p> <p> For this must ever be</p> <p> A secret, kept from all the rest,</p> <p> Between yourself and me.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'</p> <p>said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'</p> <p></p> <p> `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had</p> <p>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit</p> <p>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't</p> <p>believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'</p> <p></p> <p> The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe</p> <p>there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to</p> <p>explain the paper.</p> <p></p> <p> `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a</p> <p>world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And</p> <p>yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his</p> <p>knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some</p> <p>meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you</p> <p>can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.</p> <p>(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)</p> <p></p> <p> `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering</p> <p>over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's</p> <p>the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,</p> <p>that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to</p> <p>the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.</p> <p>Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my</p> <p>dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the</p> <p>Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off</p> <p>writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no</p> <p>mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was</p> <p>trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round</p> <p>the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and</p> <p>everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the</p> <p>King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having</p> <p>the sentence first!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't!' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</p> <p>Nobody moved.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full</p> <p>size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'</p> <p></p> <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying</p> <p>down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half</p> <p>of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on</p> <p>the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently</p> <p>brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the</p> <p>trees upon her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long</p> <p>sleep you've had!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told</p> <p>her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange</p> <p>Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and</p> <p>when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a</p> <p>curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's</p> <p>getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she</p> <p>ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</p> <p></p> <p> But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her</p> <p>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of</p> <p>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began</p> <p>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--</p> <p></p> <p> First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the</p> <p>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes</p> <p>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her</p> <p>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back</p> <p>the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and</p> <p>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place</p> <p>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little</p> <p>sister's dream.</p> <p></p> <p> The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried</p> <p>by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the</p> <p>neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as</p> <p>the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,</p> <p>and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate</p> <p>guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the</p> <p>Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once</p> <p>more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's</p> <p>slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,</p> <p>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable</p> <p>Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in</p> <p>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and</p> <p>all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only</p> <p>rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the</p> <p>reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-</p> <p>bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd</p> <p>boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and</p> <p>all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the</p> <p>confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the</p> <p>cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's</p> <p>heavy sobs.</p> <p></p> <p> Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of</p> <p>hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how</p> <p>she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and</p> <p>loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about</p> <p>her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager</p> <p>with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of</p> <p>Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their</p> <p>simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,</p> <p>remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</p> <p></p> <p> THE END</p>
ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND</p> <p></p> <p> Lewis Carroll</p> <p></p> <p> THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER I</p> <p></p> <p> Down the Rabbit-Hole</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister</p> <p>on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had</p> <p>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no</p> <p>pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'</p> <p>thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'</p> <p></p> <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,</p> <p>for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether</p> <p>the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble</p> <p>of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White</p> <p>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p> <p></p> <p> There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice</p> <p>think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to</p> <p>itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought</p> <p>it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have</p> <p>wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);</p> <p>but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-</p> <p>POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to</p> <p>her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never</p> <p>before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to</p> <p>take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the</p> <p>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop</p> <p>down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p> <p></p> <p> In another moment down went Alice after it, never once</p> <p>considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,</p> <p>and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a</p> <p>moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself</p> <p>falling down a very deep well.</p> <p></p> <p> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she</p> <p>had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to</p> <p>wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look</p> <p>down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to</p> <p>see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and</p> <p>noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;</p> <p>here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She</p> <p>took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was</p> <p>labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it</p> <p>was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing</p> <p>somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she</p> <p>fell past it.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I</p> <p>shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll</p> <p>all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,</p> <p>even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely</p> <p>true.)</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! `I</p> <p>wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.</p> <p>`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let</p> <p>me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,</p> <p>you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her</p> <p>lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good</p> <p>opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to</p> <p>listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,</p> <p>that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude</p> <p>or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,</p> <p>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to</p> <p>say.)</p> <p></p> <p> Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right</p> <p>THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the</p> <p>people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I</p> <p>think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this</p> <p>time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall</p> <p>have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.</p> <p>Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried</p> <p>to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling</p> <p>through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what</p> <p>an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll</p> <p>never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon</p> <p>began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I</p> <p>should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember</p> <p>her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were</p> <p>down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but</p> <p>you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.</p> <p>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get</p> <p>rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of</p> <p>way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do</p> <p>bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either</p> <p>question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt</p> <p>that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she</p> <p>was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very</p> <p>earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a</p> <p>bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of</p> <p>sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a</p> <p>moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her</p> <p>was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in</p> <p>sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:</p> <p>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it</p> <p>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late</p> <p>it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the</p> <p>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found</p> <p>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps</p> <p>hanging from the roof.</p> <p></p> <p> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;</p> <p>and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the</p> <p>other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,</p> <p>wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of</p> <p>solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,</p> <p>and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the</p> <p>doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or</p> <p>the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of</p> <p>them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low</p> <p>curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little</p> <p>door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key</p> <p>in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p> <p></p> <p> Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small</p> <p>passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and</p> <p>looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</p> <p>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about</p> <p>among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but</p> <p>she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if</p> <p>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of</p> <p>very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish</p> <p>I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only</p> <p>know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things</p> <p>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few</p> <p>things indeed were really impossible.</p> <p></p> <p> There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she</p> <p>went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on</p> <p>it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like</p> <p>telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which</p> <p>certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck</p> <p>of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'</p> <p>beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p> <p></p> <p> It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little</p> <p>Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look</p> <p>first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';</p> <p>for she had read several nice little histories about children who</p> <p>had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant</p> <p>things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules</p> <p>their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker</p> <p>will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your</p> <p>finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had</p> <p>never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked</p> <p>`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or</p> <p>later.</p> <p></p> <p> However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured</p> <p>to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort</p> <p>of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast</p> <p>turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished</p> <p>it off.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up</p> <p>like a telescope.'</p> <p></p> <p> And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and</p> <p>her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right</p> <p>size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.</p> <p>First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was</p> <p>going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about</p> <p>this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my</p> <p>going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be</p> <p>like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is</p> <p>like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember</p> <p>ever having seen such a thing.</p> <p></p> <p> After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided</p> <p>on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!</p> <p>when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the</p> <p>little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,</p> <p>she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it</p> <p>quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb</p> <p>up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;</p> <p>and when she had tired herself out with trying,</p> <p>the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to</p> <p>herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'</p> <p>She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very</p> <p>seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so</p> <p>severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered</p> <p>trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game</p> <p>of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious</p> <p>child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no</p> <p>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why,</p> <p>there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable</p> <p>person!'</p> <p></p> <p> Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under</p> <p>the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on</p> <p>which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.</p> <p>`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,</p> <p>I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep</p> <p>under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I</p> <p>don't care which happens!'</p> <p></p> <p> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which</p> <p>way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to</p> <p>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to</p> <p>find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally</p> <p>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the</p> <p>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,</p> <p>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the</p> <p>common way.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER II</p> <p></p> <p> The Pool of Tears</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much</p> <p>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good</p> <p>English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that</p> <p>ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her</p> <p>feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so</p> <p>far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on</p> <p>your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't</p> <p>be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself</p> <p>about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be</p> <p>kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the</p> <p>way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of</p> <p>boots every Christmas.'</p> <p></p> <p> And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.</p> <p>`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll</p> <p>seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the</p> <p>directions will look!</p> <p></p> <p> ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</p> <p> HEARTHRUG,</p> <p> NEAR THE FENDER,</p> <p> (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).</p> <p></p> <p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in</p> <p>fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took</p> <p>up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p> <p></p> <p> Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one</p> <p>side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get</p> <p>through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to</p> <p>cry again.</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great</p> <p>girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in</p> <p>this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all</p> <p>the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool</p> <p>all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the</p> <p>hall.</p> <p></p> <p> After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the</p> <p>distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p> <p>It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a</p> <p>pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the</p> <p>other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to</p> <p>himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she</p> <p>be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate</p> <p>that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit</p> <p>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,</p> <p>sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid</p> <p>gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard</p> <p>as he could go.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very</p> <p>hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:</p> <p>`Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday</p> <p>things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in</p> <p>the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this</p> <p>morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little</p> <p>different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in</p> <p>the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began</p> <p>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age</p> <p>as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of</p> <p>them.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such</p> <p>long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm</p> <p>sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,</p> <p>oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,</p> <p>and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the</p> <p>things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,</p> <p>and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!</p> <p>I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the</p> <p>Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.</p> <p>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,</p> <p>and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been</p> <p>changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'</p> <p>and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,</p> <p>and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and</p> <p>strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--</p> <p></p> <p> `How doth the little crocodile</p> <p> Improve his shining tail,</p> <p> And pour the waters of the Nile</p> <p> On every golden scale!</p> <p></p> <p> `How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p> <p> How neatly spread his claws,</p> <p> And welcome little fishes in</p> <p> With gently smiling jaws!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and</p> <p>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel</p> <p>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little</p> <p>house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so</p> <p>many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm</p> <p>Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their</p> <p>heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look</p> <p>up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I</p> <p>like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down</p> <p>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a</p> <p>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads</p> <p>down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was</p> <p>surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little</p> <p>white kid gloves while she was talking. `How CAN I have done</p> <p>that?' she thought. `I must be growing small again.' She got up</p> <p>and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,</p> <p>as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,</p> <p>and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the</p> <p>cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it</p> <p>hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p> <p></p> <p>`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at</p> <p>the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in</p> <p>existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed</p> <p>back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut</p> <p>again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as</p> <p>before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,</p> <p>`for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare</p> <p>it's too bad, that it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another</p> <p>moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first</p> <p>idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that</p> <p>case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had</p> <p>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general</p> <p>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find</p> <p>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in</p> <p>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and</p> <p>behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that</p> <p>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine</p> <p>feet high.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,</p> <p>trying to find her way out. `I shall be punished for it now, I</p> <p>suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer</p> <p>thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a</p> <p>little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at</p> <p>first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then</p> <p>she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that</p> <p>it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this</p> <p>mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should</p> <p>think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in</p> <p>trying.' So she began: `O Mouse, do you know the way out of</p> <p>this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'</p> <p>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:</p> <p>she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having</p> <p>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a</p> <p>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather</p> <p>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little</p> <p>eyes, but it said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I</p> <p>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the</p> <p>Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had</p> <p>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she</p> <p>began again: `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in</p> <p>her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the</p> <p>water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg</p> <p>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the</p> <p>poor animal's feelings. `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate</p> <p>voice. `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: `don't be</p> <p>angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:</p> <p>I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</p> <p>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,</p> <p>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so</p> <p>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and</p> <p>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital</p> <p>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,</p> <p>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt</p> <p>certain it must be really offended. `We won't talk about her any</p> <p>more if you'd rather not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end</p> <p>of his tail. `As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family</p> <p>always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear</p> <p>the name again!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the</p> <p>subject of conversation. `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'</p> <p>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: `There is</p> <p>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</p> <p>A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly</p> <p>brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and</p> <p>it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I</p> <p>can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you</p> <p>know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!</p> <p>He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the</p> <p>Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and</p> <p>making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p> <p></p> <p> So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear! Do come back</p> <p>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't</p> <p>like them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam</p> <p>slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice</p> <p>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to</p> <p>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll</p> <p>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded</p> <p>with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a</p> <p>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious</p> <p>creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the</p> <p>shore.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER III</p> <p></p> <p> A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the</p> <p>bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their</p> <p>fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and</p> <p>uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they</p> <p>had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed</p> <p>quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with</p> <p>them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had</p> <p>quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,</p> <p>and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';</p> <p>and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,</p> <p>and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no</p> <p>more to be said.</p> <p></p> <p> At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among</p> <p>them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL</p> <p>soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large</p> <p>ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes</p> <p>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad</p> <p>cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?</p> <p>This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!</p> <p>"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was</p> <p>soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been</p> <p>of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very</p> <p>politely: `Did you speak?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought you did,' said the Mouse. `--I proceed. "Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:</p> <p>and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found</p> <p>it advisable--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.</p> <p></p> <p> `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: `of course you</p> <p>know what "it" means.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said</p> <p>the Duck: `it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is,</p> <p>what did the archbishop find?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,</p> <p>`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William</p> <p>and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was</p> <p>moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you</p> <p>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it</p> <p>spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: `it doesn't</p> <p>seem to dry me at all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I</p> <p>move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more</p> <p>energetic remedies--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak English!' said the Eaglet. `I don't know the meaning of</p> <p>half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do</p> <p>either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:</p> <p>some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p> <p></p> <p> `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,</p> <p>`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much</p> <p>to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY</p> <p>ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'</p> <p>(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter</p> <p>day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p> <p></p> <p> First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the</p> <p>exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party</p> <p>were placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One,</p> <p>two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,</p> <p>and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know</p> <p>when the race was over. However, when they had been running half</p> <p>an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called</p> <p>out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,</p> <p>and asking, `But who has won?'</p> <p></p> <p> This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of</p> <p>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon</p> <p>its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,</p> <p>in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At</p> <p>last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have</p> <p>prizes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices</p> <p>asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with</p> <p>one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,</p> <p>calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand</p> <p>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt</p> <p>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</p> <p>There was exactly one a-piece all round.</p> <p></p> <p> `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have</p> <p>you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.</p> <p></p> <p> Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo</p> <p>solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of</p> <p>this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short</p> <p>speech, they all cheered.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked</p> <p>so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not</p> <p>think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,</p> <p>looking as solemn as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise</p> <p>and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not</p> <p>taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on</p> <p>the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again</p> <p>in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p> <p></p> <p> `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,</p> <p>`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half</p> <p>afraid that it would be offended again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to</p> <p>Alice, and sighing.</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with</p> <p>wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And</p> <p>she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so</p> <p>that her idea of the tale was something like this:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Fury said to a</p> <p> mouse, That he</p> <p> met in the</p> <p> house,</p> <p> "Let us</p> <p> both go to</p> <p> law: I will</p> <p> prosecute</p> <p> YOU. --Come,</p> <p> I'll take no</p> <p> denial; We</p> <p> must have a</p> <p> trial: For</p> <p> really this</p> <p> morning I've</p> <p> nothing</p> <p> to do."</p> <p> Said the</p> <p> mouse to the</p> <p> cur, "Such</p> <p> a trial,</p> <p> dear Sir,</p> <p> With</p> <p> no jury</p> <p> or judge,</p> <p> would be</p> <p> wasting</p> <p> our</p> <p> breath."</p> <p> "I'll be</p> <p> judge, I'll</p> <p> be jury,"</p> <p> Said</p> <p> cunning</p> <p> old Fury:</p> <p> "I'll</p> <p> try the</p> <p> whole</p> <p> cause,</p> <p> and</p> <p> condemn</p> <p> you</p> <p> to</p> <p> death."'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.</p> <p>`What are you thinking of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to</p> <p>the fifth bend, I think?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up</p> <p>and walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily</p> <p>offended, you know!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse only growled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after</p> <p>it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but</p> <p>the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little</p> <p>quicker.</p> <p></p> <p> `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it</p> <p>was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of</p> <p>saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you</p> <p>never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the</p> <p>young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the</p> <p>patience of an oyster!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,</p> <p>addressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'</p> <p>said the Lory.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about</p> <p>her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for</p> <p>catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her</p> <p>after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look</p> <p>at it!'</p> <p></p> <p> This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</p> <p>Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began</p> <p>wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be</p> <p>getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary</p> <p>called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my</p> <p>dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts</p> <p>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a</p> <p>melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm</p> <p>sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I</p> <p>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice</p> <p>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</p> <p>In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of</p> <p>footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping</p> <p>that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to</p> <p>finish his story.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IV</p> <p></p> <p> The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;</p> <p>and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!</p> <p>Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me</p> <p>executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have</p> <p>dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was</p> <p>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she</p> <p>very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were</p> <p>nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her</p> <p>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and</p> <p>the little door, had vanished completely.</p> <p></p> <p> Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,</p> <p>and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE</p> <p>you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of</p> <p>gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened</p> <p>that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without</p> <p>trying to explain the mistake it had made.</p> <p></p> <p> `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.</p> <p>`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd</p> <p>better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'</p> <p>As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door</p> <p>of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'</p> <p>engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried</p> <p>upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,</p> <p>and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and</p> <p>gloves.</p> <p></p> <p> `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going</p> <p>messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on</p> <p>messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that</p> <p>would happen: `"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready</p> <p>for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see</p> <p>that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went</p> <p>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering</p> <p>people about like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with</p> <p>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two</p> <p>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and</p> <p>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when</p> <p>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-</p> <p>glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'</p> <p>but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know</p> <p>SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,</p> <p>`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this</p> <p>bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for</p> <p>really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'</p> <p></p> <p> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:</p> <p>before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing</p> <p>against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being</p> <p>broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself</p> <p>`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I</p> <p>can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so</p> <p>much!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and</p> <p>growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in</p> <p>another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried</p> <p>the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the</p> <p>other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,</p> <p>as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one</p> <p>foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,</p> <p>whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'</p> <p></p> <p> Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full</p> <p>effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,</p> <p>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting</p> <p>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one</p> <p>wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about</p> <p>by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that</p> <p>rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,</p> <p>this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!</p> <p>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing</p> <p>never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There</p> <p>ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when</p> <p>I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more</p> <p>HERE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I</p> <p>am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--</p> <p>but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you</p> <p>learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no</p> <p>room at all for any lesson-books!'</p> <p></p> <p> And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,</p> <p>and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few</p> <p>minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves</p> <p>this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the</p> <p>stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and</p> <p>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she</p> <p>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no</p> <p>reason to be afraid of it.</p> <p></p> <p> Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;</p> <p>but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed</p> <p>hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it</p> <p>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she</p> <p>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly</p> <p>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not</p> <p>get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,</p> <p>and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was</p> <p>just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something</p> <p>of the sort.</p> <p></p> <p> Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are</p> <p>you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then</p> <p>I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!</p> <p>Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')</p> <p></p> <p> `An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it</p> <p>fills the whole window!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it</p> <p>away!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear</p> <p>whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer</p> <p>honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at</p> <p>last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in</p> <p>the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more</p> <p>sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there</p> <p>must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for</p> <p>pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I</p> <p>don't want to stay in here any longer!'</p> <p></p> <p> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at</p> <p>last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a</p> <p>good many voices all talking together: she made out the words:</p> <p>`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;</p> <p>Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up</p> <p>at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half</p> <p>high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--</p> <p>Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind</p> <p>that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud</p> <p>crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go</p> <p>down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,</p> <p>then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to</p> <p>go down the chimney!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said</p> <p>Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!</p> <p>I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is</p> <p>narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'</p> <p></p> <p> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and</p> <p>waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what</p> <p>sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close</p> <p>above her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one</p> <p>sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes</p> <p>Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the</p> <p>hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold</p> <p>up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?</p> <p>What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'</p> <p></p> <p> Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'</p> <p>thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm</p> <p>better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know</p> <p>is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes</p> <p>like a sky-rocket!'</p> <p></p> <p> `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and</p> <p>Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do. I'll set</p> <p>Dinah at you!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to</p> <p>herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any</p> <p>sense, they'd take the roof off.' After a minute or two, they</p> <p>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A</p> <p>barrowful will do, to begin with.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to</p> <p>doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came</p> <p>rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.</p> <p>`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,</p> <p>`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead</p> <p>silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all</p> <p>turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright</p> <p>idea came into her head. `If I eat one of these cakes,' she</p> <p>thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it</p> <p>can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I</p> <p>suppose.'</p> <p></p> <p> So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find</p> <p>that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small</p> <p>enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and</p> <p>found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.</p> <p>The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by</p> <p>two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.</p> <p>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she</p> <p>ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a</p> <p>thick wood.</p> <p></p> <p> `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she</p> <p>wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;</p> <p>and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</p> <p>I think that will be the best plan.'</p> <p></p> <p> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and</p> <p>simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the</p> <p>smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering</p> <p>about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over</p> <p>her head made her look up in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round</p> <p>eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</p> <p>`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried</p> <p>hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the</p> <p>time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it</p> <p>would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</p> <p></p> <p> Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of</p> <p>stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped</p> <p>into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,</p> <p>and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice</p> <p>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run</p> <p>over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy</p> <p>made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in</p> <p>its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very</p> <p>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every</p> <p>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle</p> <p>again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the</p> <p>stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long</p> <p>way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat</p> <p>down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its</p> <p>mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p> <p></p> <p> This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;</p> <p>so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out</p> <p>of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the</p> <p>distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she</p> <p>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself</p> <p>with one of the leaves: `I should have liked teaching it tricks</p> <p>very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh</p> <p>dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let</p> <p>me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or</p> <p>drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'</p> <p></p> <p> The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round</p> <p>her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see</p> <p>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under</p> <p>the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,</p> <p>about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under</p> <p>it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her</p> <p>that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.</p> <p></p> <p> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of</p> <p>the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large</p> <p>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,</p> <p>quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice</p> <p>of her or of anything else.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER V</p> <p></p> <p> Advice from a Caterpillar</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in</p> <p>silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice</p> <p>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--</p> <p>at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think</p> <p>I must have been changed several times since then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</p> <p>`Explain yourself!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because</p> <p>I'm not myself, you see.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very</p> <p>politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and</p> <p>being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but</p> <p>when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you</p> <p>know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll</p> <p>feel it a little queer, won't you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;</p> <p>`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. `Who are YOU?'</p> <p></p> <p> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the</p> <p>conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's</p> <p>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,</p> <p>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not</p> <p>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in</p> <p>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. `I've something</p> <p>important to say!'</p> <p></p> <p> This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as</p> <p>she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else</p> <p>to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth</p> <p>hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but</p> <p>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth</p> <p>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as</p> <p>I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it</p> <p>all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice folded her hands, and began:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,</p> <p> `And your hair has become very white;</p> <p> And yet you incessantly stand on your head--</p> <p> Do you think, at your age, it is right?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,</p> <p> `I feared it might injure the brain;</p> <p> But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,</p> <p> Why, I do it again and again.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,</p> <p> And have grown most uncommonly fat;</p> <p> Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--</p> <p> Pray, what is the reason of that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</p> <p> `I kept all my limbs very supple</p> <p> By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--</p> <p> Allow me to sell you a couple?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak</p> <p> For anything tougher than suet;</p> <p> Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--</p> <p> Pray how did you manage to do it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,</p> <p> And argued each case with my wife;</p> <p> And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,</p> <p> Has lasted the rest of my life.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose</p> <p> That your eye was as steady as ever;</p> <p> Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--</p> <p> What made you so awfully clever?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'</p> <p> Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!</p> <p> Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?</p> <p> Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the</p> <p>words have got altered.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.</p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar was the first to speak.</p> <p></p> <p> `What size do you want to be?' it asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;</p> <p>`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in</p> <p>her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you</p> <p>wouldn't mind,' said Alice: `three inches is such a wretched</p> <p>height to be.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three</p> <p>inches high).</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</p> <p>And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so</p> <p>easily offended!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it</p> <p>put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</p> <p></p> <p> This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</p> <p>In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got</p> <p>down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely</p> <p>remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and</p> <p>the other side will make you grow shorter.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had</p> <p>asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a</p> <p>minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as</p> <p>it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</p> <p>However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they</p> <p>would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p> <p></p> <p> `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a</p> <p>little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment</p> <p>she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her</p> <p>foot!</p> <p></p> <p> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but</p> <p>she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking</p> <p>rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.</p> <p>Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was</p> <p>hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and</p> <p>managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of</p> <p>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she</p> <p>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could</p> <p>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which</p> <p>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay</p> <p>far below her.</p> <p></p> <p> `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. `And where</p> <p>HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I</p> <p>can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no</p> <p>result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the</p> <p>distant green leaves.</p> <p></p> <p> As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her</p> <p>head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted</p> <p>to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,</p> <p>like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a</p> <p>graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which</p> <p>she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she</p> <p>had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a</p> <p>hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating</p> <p>her violently with its wings.</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. `Let me alone!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more</p> <p>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every</p> <p>way, and nothing seems to suit them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've</p> <p>tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but</p> <p>those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no</p> <p>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</p> <p></p> <p> `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the</p> <p>Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and</p> <p>day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was</p> <p>beginning to see its meaning.</p> <p></p> <p> `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued</p> <p>the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was</p> <p>thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come</p> <p>wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. `I'm a--I'm</p> <p>a--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're</p> <p>trying to invent something!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she</p> <p>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the</p> <p>deepest contempt. `I've seen a good many little girls in my</p> <p>time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a</p> <p>serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be</p> <p>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very</p> <p>truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as</p> <p>serpents do, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why</p> <p>then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent</p> <p>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of</p> <p>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and</p> <p>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a</p> <p>serpent?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm</p> <p>not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't</p> <p>want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it</p> <p>settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the</p> <p>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled</p> <p>among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and</p> <p>untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the</p> <p>pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very</p> <p>carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and</p> <p>growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had</p> <p>succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p> <p></p> <p> It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,</p> <p>that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a</p> <p>few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come,</p> <p>there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes</p> <p>are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to</p> <p>another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next</p> <p>thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be</p> <p>done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an</p> <p>open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</p> <p>`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come</p> <p>upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their</p> <p>wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did</p> <p>not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself</p> <p>down to nine inches high.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VI</p> <p></p> <p> Pig and Pepper</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and</p> <p>wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came</p> <p>running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman</p> <p>because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only,</p> <p>she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door</p> <p>with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,</p> <p>with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,</p> <p>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their</p> <p>heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and</p> <p>crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great</p> <p>letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to</p> <p>the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess. An</p> <p>invitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman</p> <p>repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the</p> <p>words a little, `From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess</p> <p>to play croquet.'</p> <p></p> <p> Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled</p> <p>together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into</p> <p>the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped</p> <p>out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the</p> <p>ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and</p> <p>that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the</p> <p>door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise</p> <p>inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was</p> <p>a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling</p> <p>and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish</p> <p>or kettle had been broken to pieces.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'</p> <p></p> <p> `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went</p> <p>on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us. For</p> <p>instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let</p> <p>you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time</p> <p>he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. `But</p> <p>perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so</p> <p>VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might</p> <p>answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate</p> <p>came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just</p> <p>grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees</p> <p>behind him.</p> <p></p> <p> `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,</p> <p>exactly as if nothing had happened.</p> <p></p> <p> `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. `That's the</p> <p>first question, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.</p> <p>`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the</p> <p>creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for</p> <p>repeating his remark, with variations. `I shall sit here,' he</p> <p>said, `on and off, for days and days.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what am I to do?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:</p> <p>`he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.</p> <p></p> <p> The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of</p> <p>smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a</p> <p>three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was</p> <p>leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to</p> <p>be full of soup.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to</p> <p>herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p> <p></p> <p> There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the</p> <p>Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was</p> <p>sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The</p> <p>only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,</p> <p>and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from</p> <p>ear to ear.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for</p> <p>she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to</p> <p>speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!'</p> <p></p> <p> She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice</p> <p>quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed</p> <p>to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I</p> <p>didn't know that cats COULD grin.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,</p> <p>feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</p> <p></p> <p> `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought</p> <p>it would be as well to introduce some other subject of</p> <p>conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took</p> <p>the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work</p> <p>throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby</p> <p>--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,</p> <p>plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when</p> <p>they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it</p> <p>was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up</p> <p>and down in an agony of terror. `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS</p> <p>nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very</p> <p>nearly carried it off.</p> <p></p> <p> `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a</p> <p>hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it</p> <p>does.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very</p> <p>glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her</p> <p>knowledge. `Just think of what work it would make with the day</p> <p>and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn</p> <p>round on its axis--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant</p> <p>to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and</p> <p>seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: `Twenty-four</p> <p>hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide</p> <p>figures!' And with that she began nursing her child again,</p> <p>singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a</p> <p>violent shake at the end of every line:</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak roughly to your little boy,</p> <p> And beat him when he sneezes:</p> <p> He only does it to annoy,</p> <p> Because he knows it teases.'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> (In which the cook and the baby joined):--</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept</p> <p>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing</p> <p>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I speak severely to my boy,</p> <p> I beat him when he sneezes;</p> <p> For he can thoroughly enjoy</p> <p> The pepper when he pleases!'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said</p> <p>to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. `I must go and</p> <p>get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of</p> <p>the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,</p> <p>but it just missed her.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-</p> <p>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all</p> <p>directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor</p> <p>little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,</p> <p>and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,</p> <p>so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much</p> <p>as she could do to hold it.</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,</p> <p>(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep</p> <p>tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its</p> <p>undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. `IF I</p> <p>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure</p> <p>to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it</p> <p>behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing</p> <p>grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). `Don't</p> <p>grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing</p> <p>yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into</p> <p>its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no</p> <p>doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout</p> <p>than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for</p> <p>a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at</p> <p>all. `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked</p> <p>into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</p> <p></p> <p> No, there were no tears. `If you're going to turn into a pig,</p> <p>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do</p> <p>with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or</p> <p>grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for</p> <p>some while in silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I</p> <p>to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted</p> <p>again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some</p> <p>alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was</p> <p>neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be</p> <p>quite absurd for her to carry it further.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to</p> <p>see it trot away quietly into the wood. `If it had grown up,'</p> <p>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:</p> <p>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began</p> <p>thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as</p> <p>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right</p> <p>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing</p> <p>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-</p> <p>natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great</p> <p>many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p> <p></p> <p> `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at</p> <p>all know whether it would like the name: however, it only</p> <p>grinned a little wider. `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought</p> <p>Alice, and she went on. `Would you tell me, please, which way I</p> <p>ought to go from here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said</p> <p>the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't much care where--' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk</p> <p>long enough.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another</p> <p>question. `What sort of people live about here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,</p> <p>`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,</p> <p>`lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.</p> <p>I'm mad. You're mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on</p> <p>`And how do you know that you're mad?'</p> <p></p> <p> `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad. You grant</p> <p>that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I suppose so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's</p> <p>angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm</p> <p>pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call it what you like,' said the Cat. `Do you play croquet</p> <p>with the Queen to-day?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been</p> <p>invited yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used</p> <p>to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place</p> <p>where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.</p> <p></p> <p> `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. `I'd</p> <p>nearly forgotten to ask.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had</p> <p>come back in a natural way.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it</p> <p>did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the</p> <p>direction in which the March Hare was said to live. `I've seen</p> <p>hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be</p> <p>much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be</p> <p>raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.' As she said</p> <p>this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a</p> <p>branch of a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep</p> <p>appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'</p> <p></p> <p> `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,</p> <p>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,</p> <p>which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever</p> <p>saw in my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the</p> <p>house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house,</p> <p>because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was</p> <p>thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not</p> <p>like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand</p> <p>bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even</p> <p>then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself</p> <p>`Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd</p> <p>gone to see the Hatter instead!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VII</p> <p></p> <p> A Mad Tea-Party</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,</p> <p>and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a</p> <p>Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two</p> <p>were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking</p> <p>over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p> <p></p> <p> The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded</p> <p>together at one corner of it: `No room! No room!' they cried</p> <p>out when they saw Alice coming. `There's PLENTY of room!' said</p> <p>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one</p> <p>end of the table.</p> <p></p> <p> `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it</p> <p>but tea. `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice</p> <p>angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being</p> <p>invited,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a</p> <p>great many more than three.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been</p> <p>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was</p> <p>his first speech.</p> <p></p> <p> `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said</p> <p>with some severity; `it's very rude.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all</p> <p>he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. `I'm glad</p> <p>they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she</p> <p>added aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'</p> <p>said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what</p> <p>I say--that's the same thing, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. `You might just</p> <p>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat</p> <p>what I see"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I</p> <p>like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to</p> <p>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the</p> <p>same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the</p> <p>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,</p> <p>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and</p> <p>writing-desks, which wasn't much.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter was the first to break the silence. `What day of</p> <p>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his</p> <p>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking</p> <p>it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. `I told you butter</p> <p>wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March</p> <p>Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter</p> <p>grumbled: `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'</p> <p></p> <p> The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then</p> <p>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he</p> <p>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It</p> <p>was the BEST butter, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</p> <p>`What a funny watch!' she remarked. `It tells the day of the</p> <p>month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. `Does YOUR watch tell</p> <p>you what year it is?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: `but that's</p> <p>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to</p> <p>have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</p> <p>`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she</p> <p>could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured</p> <p>a little hot tea upon its nose.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without</p> <p>opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to</p> <p>remark myself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to</p> <p>Alice again.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I give it up,' Alice replied: `what's the answer?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nor I,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice sighed wearily. `I think you might do something better</p> <p>with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that</p> <p>have no answers.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you</p> <p>wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head</p> <p>contemptuously. `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: `but I know I have to</p> <p>beat time when I learn music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. `He won't stand</p> <p>beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do</p> <p>almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose</p> <p>it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:</p> <p>you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the</p> <p>clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'</p> <p></p> <p> (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a</p> <p>whisper.)</p> <p></p> <p> `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:</p> <p>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: `but you could keep</p> <p>it to half-past one as long as you liked.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter shook his head mournfully. `Not I!' he replied.</p> <p>`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'</p> <p>(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the</p> <p>great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing</p> <p></p> <p> "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</p> <p> How I wonder what you're at!"</p> <p></p> <p>You know the song, perhaps?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--</p> <p></p> <p> "Up above the world you fly,</p> <p> Like a tea-tray in the sky.</p> <p> Twinkle, twinkle--"'</p> <p></p> <p>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep</p> <p>`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that</p> <p>they had to pinch it to make it stop.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,</p> <p>`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the</p> <p>time! Off with his head!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,</p> <p>`he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'</p> <p></p> <p> A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so</p> <p>many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always</p> <p>tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice</p> <p>ventured to ask.</p> <p></p> <p> `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,</p> <p>yawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady</p> <p>tells us a story.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at</p> <p>the proposal.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. `Wake up,</p> <p>Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. `I wasn't asleep,' he</p> <p>said in a hoarse, feeble voice: `I heard every word you fellows</p> <p>were saying.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep</p> <p>again before it's done.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the</p> <p>Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,</p> <p>Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great</p> <p>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</p> <p></p> <p> `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a</p> <p>minute or two.</p> <p></p> <p> `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently</p> <p>remarked; `they'd have been ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways</p> <p>of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went</p> <p>on: `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very</p> <p>earnestly.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so</p> <p>I can't take more.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very</p> <p>easy to take MORE than nothing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked</p> <p>triumphantly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped</p> <p>herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the</p> <p>Dormouse, and repeated her question. `Why did they live at the</p> <p>bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and</p> <p>then said, `It was a treacle-well.'</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but</p> <p>the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse</p> <p>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the</p> <p>story for yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt</p> <p>again. I dare say there may be ONE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he</p> <p>consented to go on. `And so these three little sisters--they</p> <p>were learning to draw, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this</p> <p>time.</p> <p></p> <p> `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: `let's all move</p> <p>one place on.'</p> <p></p> <p> He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the</p> <p>March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather</p> <p>unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the</p> <p>only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a</p> <p>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset</p> <p>the milk-jug into his plate.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began</p> <p>very cautiously: `But I don't understand. Where did they draw</p> <p>the treacle from?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so</p> <p>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,</p> <p>stupid?'</p> <p></p> <p> `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not</p> <p>choosing to notice this last remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'</p> <p></p> <p> This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse</p> <p>go on for some time without interrupting it.</p> <p></p> <p> `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and</p> <p>rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew</p> <p>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why with an M?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why not?' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going</p> <p>off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up</p> <p>again with a little shriek, and went on: `--that begins with an</p> <p>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--</p> <p>you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever</p> <p>see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I</p> <p>don't think--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got</p> <p>up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep</p> <p>instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her</p> <p>going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that</p> <p>they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were</p> <p>trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</p> <p></p> <p> `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she</p> <p>picked her way through the wood. `It's the stupidest tea-party I</p> <p>ever was at in all my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a</p> <p>door leading right into it. `That's very curious!' she thought.</p> <p>`But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.'</p> <p>And in she went.</p> <p></p> <p> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the</p> <p>little glass table. `Now, I'll manage better this time,'</p> <p>she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,</p> <p>and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went</p> <p>to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it</p> <p>in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down</p> <p>the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the</p> <p>beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VIII</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's Croquet-Ground</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the</p> <p>roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at</p> <p>it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious</p> <p>thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up</p> <p>to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go</p> <p>splashing paint over me like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged</p> <p>my elbow.'</p> <p></p> <p> On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always</p> <p>lay the blame on others!'</p> <p></p> <p> `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. `I heard the Queen say only</p> <p>yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it</p> <p>was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'</p> <p></p> <p> Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all</p> <p>the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as</p> <p>she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the</p> <p>others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are</p> <p>painting those roses?'</p> <p></p> <p> Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a</p> <p>low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to</p> <p>have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;</p> <p>and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads</p> <p>cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore</p> <p>she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously</p> <p>looking across the garden, called out `The Queen! The Queen!'</p> <p>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon</p> <p>their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice</p> <p>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped</p> <p>like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and</p> <p>feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were</p> <p>ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the</p> <p>soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were</p> <p>ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand</p> <p>in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next</p> <p>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice</p> <p>recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous</p> <p>manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without</p> <p>noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the</p> <p>King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this</p> <p>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on</p> <p>her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember</p> <p>ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,</p> <p>what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people</p> <p>had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'</p> <p>So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p> <p></p> <p> When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped</p> <p>and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'</p> <p>She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,</p> <p>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'</p> <p></p> <p> `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very</p> <p>politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of</p> <p>cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three</p> <p>gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as</p> <p>they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs</p> <p>was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether</p> <p>they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her</p> <p>own children.</p> <p></p> <p> `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</p> <p>`It's no business of MINE.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her</p> <p>for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!</p> <p>Off--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the</p> <p>Queen was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said</p> <p>`Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave</p> <p>`Turn them over!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p> <p></p> <p> `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the</p> <p>three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the</p> <p>King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</p> <p></p> <p> `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. `You make me giddy.'</p> <p>And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you</p> <p>been doing here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,</p> <p>going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the</p> <p>roses. `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,</p> <p>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate</p> <p>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</p> <p></p> <p> `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a</p> <p>large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered</p> <p>about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly</p> <p>marched off after the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers</p> <p>shouted in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's right!' shouted the Queen. `Can you play croquet?'</p> <p></p> <p> The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question</p> <p>was evidently meant for her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes!' shouted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the</p> <p>procession, wondering very much what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.</p> <p>She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously</p> <p>into her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very,' said Alice: `--where's the Duchess?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He</p> <p>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised</p> <p>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and</p> <p>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I didn't,' said Alice: `I don't think it's at all a pity.</p> <p>I said "What for?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a</p> <p>little scream of laughter. `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a</p> <p>frightened tone. `The Queen will hear you! You see, she came</p> <p>rather late, and the Queen said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,</p> <p>and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up</p> <p>against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or</p> <p>two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a</p> <p>curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and</p> <p>furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live</p> <p>flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to</p> <p>stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p> <p></p> <p> The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her</p> <p>flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,</p> <p>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,</p> <p>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened</p> <p>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it</p> <p>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a</p> <p>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:</p> <p>and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,</p> <p>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled</p> <p>itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,</p> <p>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she</p> <p>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers</p> <p>were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the</p> <p>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very</p> <p>difficult game indeed.</p> <p></p> <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns,</p> <p>quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in</p> <p>a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went</p> <p>stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with</p> <p>her head!' about once in a minute.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as</p> <p>yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might</p> <p>happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of</p> <p>me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great</p> <p>wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'</p> <p></p> <p> She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering</p> <p>whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a</p> <p>curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at</p> <p>first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to</p> <p>be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat: now I</p> <p>shall have somebody to talk to.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was</p> <p>mouth enough for it to speak with.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. `It's no</p> <p>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at</p> <p>least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared,</p> <p>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the</p> <p>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The</p> <p>Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and</p> <p>no more of it appeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather</p> <p>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't</p> <p>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in</p> <p>particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and</p> <p>you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;</p> <p>for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next</p> <p>walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have</p> <p>croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it</p> <p>saw mine coming!'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at all,' said Alice: `she's so extremely--' Just then</p> <p>she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so</p> <p>she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while</p> <p>finishing the game.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen smiled and passed on.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and</p> <p>looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: `allow me</p> <p>to introduce it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:</p> <p>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me</p> <p>like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. `I've read that in</p> <p>some book, but I don't remember where.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and</p> <p>he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear! I</p> <p>wish you would have this cat removed!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great</p> <p>or small. `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking</p> <p>round.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and</p> <p>he hurried off.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game</p> <p>was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,</p> <p>screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three</p> <p>of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and</p> <p>she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in</p> <p>such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or</p> <p>not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p> <p></p> <p> The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,</p> <p>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one</p> <p>of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her</p> <p>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where</p> <p>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up</p> <p>into a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,</p> <p>the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:</p> <p>`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches</p> <p>are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away</p> <p>under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for</p> <p>a little more conversation with her friend.</p> <p></p> <p> When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to</p> <p>find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute</p> <p>going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who</p> <p>were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,</p> <p>and looked very uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to</p> <p>settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,</p> <p>though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed</p> <p>to make out exactly what they said.</p> <p></p> <p> The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a</p> <p>head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had</p> <p>never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin</p> <p>at HIS time of life.</p> <p></p> <p> The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be</p> <p>beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about</p> <p>it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.</p> <p>(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so</p> <p>grave and anxious.)</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the</p> <p>Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: `fetch</p> <p>her here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,</p> <p>by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely</p> <p>disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down</p> <p>looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IX</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle's Story</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old</p> <p>thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately</p> <p>into Alice's, and they walked off together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and</p> <p>thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had</p> <p>made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p> `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very</p> <p>hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT</p> <p>ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that</p> <p>makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at</p> <p>having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them</p> <p>sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar</p> <p>and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish</p> <p>people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you</p> <p>know--'</p> <p></p> <p> She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a</p> <p>little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</p> <p>`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you</p> <p>forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that</p> <p>is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. `Everything's got a</p> <p>moral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up</p> <p>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first,</p> <p>because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was</p> <p>exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,</p> <p>and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not</p> <p>like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of</p> <p>keeping up the conversation a little.</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis so,' said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--"Oh,</p> <p>'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody</p> <p>minding their own business!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,</p> <p>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,</p> <p>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the</p> <p>sounds will take care of themselves."'</p> <p></p> <p> `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your</p> <p>waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I'm</p> <p>doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the</p> <p>experiment?'</p> <p></p> <p> `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all</p> <p>anxious to have the experiment tried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very true,' said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both</p> <p>bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock</p> <p>together."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: `what a clear way you</p> <p>have of putting things!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree</p> <p>to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near</p> <p>here. And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the</p> <p>less there is of yours."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this</p> <p>last remark, `it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it</p> <p>is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of</p> <p>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put</p> <p>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than</p> <p>what it might appear to others that what you were or might have</p> <p>been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared</p> <p>to them to be otherwise."'</p> <p></p> <p> `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very</p> <p>politely, `if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it</p> <p>as you say it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess</p> <p>replied, in a pleased tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'</p> <p>said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. `I make you</p> <p>a present of everything I've said as yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. `I'm glad they don't</p> <p>give birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to</p> <p>say it out loud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her</p> <p>sharp little chin.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was</p> <p>beginning to feel a little worried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;</p> <p>and the m--'</p> <p></p> <p> But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died</p> <p>away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the</p> <p>arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up,</p> <p>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,</p> <p>frowning like a thunderstorm.</p> <p></p> <p> `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on</p> <p>the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,</p> <p>and that in about half no time! Take your choice!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p> <p></p> <p> `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice</p> <p>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her</p> <p>back to the croquet-ground.</p> <p></p> <p> The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,</p> <p>and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her,</p> <p>they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a</p> <p>moment's delay would cost them their lives.</p> <p></p> <p> All the time they were playing the Queen never left off</p> <p>quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his</p> <p>head!' or `Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were</p> <p>taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave</p> <p>off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour</p> <p>or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the</p> <p>King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of</p> <p>execution.</p> <p></p> <p> Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to</p> <p>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said Alice. `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his</p> <p>history,'</p> <p></p> <p> As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low</p> <p>voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.' `Come,</p> <p>THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite</p> <p>unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p> <p></p> <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the</p> <p>sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)</p> <p>`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to</p> <p>see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and</p> <p>see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,</p> <p>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like</p> <p>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would</p> <p>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage</p> <p>Queen: so she waited.</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the</p> <p>Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!'</p> <p>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the fun?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. `It's all her fancy, that: they</p> <p>never executes nobody, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went</p> <p>slowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life,</p> <p>never!'</p> <p></p> <p> They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the</p> <p>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,</p> <p>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart</p> <p>would break. She pitied him deeply. `What is his sorrow?' she</p> <p>asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the</p> <p>same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got</p> <p>no sorrow, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with</p> <p>large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to</p> <p>know your history, she do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow</p> <p>tone: `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've</p> <p>finished.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice</p> <p>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he</p> <p>doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.</p> <p></p> <p> `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was</p> <p>a real Turtle.'</p> <p></p> <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only</p> <p>by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and</p> <p>the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very</p> <p>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your</p> <p>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be</p> <p>more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more</p> <p>calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to</p> <p>school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call</p> <p>him Tortoise--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle angrily: `really you are very dull!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple</p> <p>question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and</p> <p>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At</p> <p>last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!</p> <p>Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe</p> <p>it--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak</p> <p>again. The Mock Turtle went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school</p> <p>every day--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be</p> <p>so proud as all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle in a tone of great relief. `Now at OURS they had at the</p> <p>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'</p> <p></p> <p> `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the</p> <p>bottom of the sea.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a</p> <p>sigh. `I only took the regular course.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was that?' inquired Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock</p> <p>Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--</p> <p>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. `What is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. `What! Never</p> <p>heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. `You know what to beautify is,</p> <p>I suppose?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to</p> <p>uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about</p> <p>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you</p> <p>to learn?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting</p> <p>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,</p> <p>with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old</p> <p>conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us</p> <p>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was THAT like?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: `I'm</p> <p>too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics</p> <p>master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he</p> <p>taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;</p> <p>and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a</p> <p>hurry to change the subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the</p> <p>next, and so on.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon</p> <p>remarked: `because they lessen from day to day.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a</p> <p>little before she made her next remark. `Then the eleventh day</p> <p>must have been a holiday?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a</p> <p>very decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER X</p> <p></p> <p> The Lobster Quadrille</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper</p> <p>across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for</p> <p>a minute or two sobs choked his voice. `Same as if he had a bone</p> <p>in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him</p> <p>and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered</p> <p>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--</p> <p>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'</p> <p>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,</p> <p>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful</p> <p>thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, indeed,' said Alice. `What sort of a dance is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;</p> <p>then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `--you advance twice--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: `advance twice, set to</p> <p>partners--'</p> <p></p> <p> `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the</p> <p>Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</p> <p></p> <p> `--as far out to sea as you can--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,</p> <p>capering wildly about.</p> <p></p> <p> `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the</p> <p>Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,</p> <p>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat</p> <p>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very much indeed,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the</p> <p>Gryphon. `We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall</p> <p>sing?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. `I've forgotten the words.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now</p> <p>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and</p> <p>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle</p> <p>sang this, very slowly and sadly:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>`"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.</p> <p>"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my</p> <p> tail.</p> <p>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</p> <p>They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be</p> <p>When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to</p> <p> sea!"</p> <p>But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look</p> <p> askance--</p> <p>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the</p> <p> dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p></p> <p>`"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.</p> <p>"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.</p> <p>The further off from England the nearer is to France--</p> <p>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</p> <p></p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p> dance?</p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p> dance?"'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said</p> <p>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: `and I do so</p> <p>like that curious song about the whiting!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've</p> <p>seen them, of course?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she</p> <p>checked herself hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but</p> <p>if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're</p> <p>like.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. `They have their</p> <p>tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:</p> <p>`crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails</p> <p>in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle</p> <p>yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all</p> <p>that,' he said to the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with</p> <p>the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So</p> <p>they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in</p> <p>their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting. I never knew</p> <p>so much about a whiting before.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the</p> <p>Gryphon. `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never thought about it,' said Alice. `Why?'</p> <p></p> <p> `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very</p> <p>solemnly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was thoroughly puzzled. `Does the boots and shoes!' she</p> <p>repeated in a wondering tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. `I</p> <p>mean, what makes them so shiny?'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she</p> <p>gave her answer. `They're done with blacking, I believe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep</p> <p>voice, `are done with a whiting. Now you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great</p> <p>curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather</p> <p>impatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were</p> <p>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep</p> <p>back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>said: `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came</p> <p>to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With</p> <p>what porpoise?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended</p> <p>tone. And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR</p> <p>adventures.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'</p> <p>said Alice a little timidly: `but it's no use going back to</p> <p>yesterday, because I was a different person then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an</p> <p>impatient tone: `explanations take such a dreadful time.'</p> <p></p> <p> So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when</p> <p>she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about</p> <p>it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on</p> <p>each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she</p> <p>gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly</p> <p>quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,</p> <p>FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming</p> <p>different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said</p> <p>`That's very curious.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated</p> <p>thoughtfully. `I should like to hear her try and repeat</p> <p>something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as</p> <p>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said</p> <p>the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat</p> <p>lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'</p> <p>However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so</p> <p>full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was</p> <p>saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,</p> <p> "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."</p> <p> As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose</p> <p> Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,</p> <p> And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,</p> <p> But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,</p> <p> His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]</p> <p></p> <p> `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'</p> <p>said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it</p> <p>sounds uncommon nonsense.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her</p> <p>hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. `Go on with</p> <p>the next verse.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. `How COULD</p> <p>he turn them out with his nose, you know?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was</p> <p>dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the</p> <p>subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:</p> <p>`it begins "I passed by his garden."'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would</p> <p>all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,</p> <p> How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,</p> <p> While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</p> <p> When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,</p> <p> Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:</p> <p> While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,</p> <p> And concluded the banquet--]</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far</p> <p>the most confusing thing I ever heard!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and</p> <p>Alice was only too glad to do so.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the</p> <p>Gryphon went on. `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you</p> <p>a song?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'</p> <p>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather</p> <p>offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her</p> <p>"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes</p> <p>choked with sobs, to sing this:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</p> <p> Waiting in a hot tureen!</p> <p> Who for such dainties would not stoop?</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,</p> <p> Game, or any other dish?</p> <p> Who would not give all else for two</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had</p> <p>just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'</p> <p>was heard in the distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,</p> <p>it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</p> <p></p> <p> `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon</p> <p>only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more</p> <p>faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the</p> <p>melancholy words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XI</p> <p></p> <p> Who Stole the Tarts?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when</p> <p>they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts</p> <p>of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:</p> <p>the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on</p> <p>each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,</p> <p>with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the</p> <p>other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large</p> <p>dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice</p> <p>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'</p> <p>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed</p> <p>to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about</p> <p>her, to pass away the time.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had</p> <p>read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that</p> <p>she knew the name of nearly everything there. `That's the</p> <p>judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'</p> <p></p> <p> The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown</p> <p>over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he</p> <p>did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly</p> <p>not becoming.</p> <p></p> <p> `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve</p> <p>creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because</p> <p>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they</p> <p>are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over</p> <p>to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and</p> <p>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the</p> <p>meaning of it at all. However, `jury-men' would have done just</p> <p>as well.</p> <p></p> <p> The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</p> <p>`What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. `They</p> <p>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in</p> <p>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the</p> <p>trial.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but</p> <p>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in</p> <p>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked</p> <p>anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their</p> <p>shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'</p> <p>on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them</p> <p>didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his</p> <p>neighbour to tell him. `A nice muddle their slates'll be in</p> <p>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,</p> <p>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got</p> <p>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it</p> <p>away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was</p> <p>Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of</p> <p>it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write</p> <p>with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very</p> <p>little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p> <p></p> <p> `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and</p> <p>then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--</p> <p></p> <p> `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,</p> <p> All on a summer day:</p> <p> The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,</p> <p> And took them quite away!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. `There's</p> <p>a great deal to come before that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit</p> <p>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First</p> <p>witness!'</p> <p></p> <p> The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in</p> <p>one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. `I beg</p> <p>pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in: but I</p> <p>hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to have finished,' said the King. `When did you</p> <p>begin?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into</p> <p>the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. `Fourteenth of March, I</p> <p>think it was,' he said.</p> <p></p> <p> `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury</p> <p>eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then</p> <p>added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</p> <p></p> <p> `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who</p> <p>instantly made a memorandum of the fact.</p> <p></p> <p> `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;</p> <p>`I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'</p> <p></p> <p> Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or</p> <p>I'll have you executed on the spot.'</p> <p></p> <p> This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept</p> <p>shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the</p> <p>Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his</p> <p>teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.</p> <p></p> <p> Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which</p> <p>puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was</p> <p>beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she</p> <p>would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she</p> <p>decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for</p> <p>her.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was</p> <p>sitting next to her. `I can hardly breathe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: `I'm growing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: `you know</p> <p>you're growing too.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:</p> <p>`not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily</p> <p>and crossed over to the other side of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to</p> <p>one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the</p> <p>singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter</p> <p>trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have</p> <p>you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a</p> <p>trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week</p> <p>or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and</p> <p>the twinkling of the tea--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.</p> <p>`Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things</p> <p>twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did!' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `I deny it!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `He denies it,' said the King: `leave out that part.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,</p> <p>looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the</p> <p>Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</p> <p></p> <p> `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-</p> <p>and-butter--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you</p> <p>executed.'</p> <p></p> <p> The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,</p> <p>and went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he</p> <p>began.</p> <p></p> <p> `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately</p> <p>suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a</p> <p>hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had</p> <p>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:</p> <p>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat</p> <p>upon it.)</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've so often</p> <p>read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some</p> <p>attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the</p> <p>officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant</p> <p>till now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'</p> <p>continued the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as</p> <p>it is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.</p> <p></p> <p> Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. `Now we</p> <p>shall get on better.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious</p> <p>look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</p> <p></p> <p> `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the</p> <p>court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.</p> <p></p> <p> `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one</p> <p>of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the</p> <p>officer could get to the door.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the next witness!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the</p> <p>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before</p> <p>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began</p> <p>sneezing all at once.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shan't,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a</p> <p>low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy</p> <p>air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till</p> <p>his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What</p> <p>are tarts made of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead that</p> <p>Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch</p> <p>him! Off with his whiskers!'</p> <p></p> <p> For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the</p> <p>Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down</p> <p>again, the cook had disappeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.</p> <p>`Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the</p> <p>Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.</p> <p>It quite makes my forehead ache!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,</p> <p>feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,</p> <p>`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.</p> <p>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top</p> <p>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XII</p> <p></p> <p> Alice's Evidence</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the</p> <p>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she</p> <p>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with</p> <p>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads</p> <p>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding</p> <p>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset</p> <p>the week before.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great</p> <p>dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,</p> <p>for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and</p> <p>she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once</p> <p>and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</p> <p></p> <p> `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave</p> <p>voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--</p> <p>ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as</p> <p>he said do.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she</p> <p>had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing</p> <p>was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable</p> <p>to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that</p> <p>it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it</p> <p>would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of</p> <p>being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and</p> <p>handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write</p> <p>out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed</p> <p>too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,</p> <p>gazing up into the roof of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you know about this business?' the King said to</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.</p> <p>They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when</p> <p>the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,</p> <p>of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and</p> <p>making faces at him as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and</p> <p>went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--</p> <p>unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word</p> <p>sounded best.</p> <p></p> <p> Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some</p> <p>`unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to</p> <p>look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she</p> <p>thought to herself.</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily</p> <p>writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out</p> <p>from his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE</p> <p>HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'</p> <p></p> <p> Everybody looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You are,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides,</p> <p>that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</p> <p>`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said</p> <p>the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has</p> <p>just been picked up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What's in it?' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems</p> <p>to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was</p> <p>written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,</p> <p>there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper</p> <p>as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set</p> <p>of verses.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of</p> <p>the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the</p> <p>queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)</p> <p></p> <p> `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.</p> <p>(The jury all brightened up again.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and</p> <p>they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the</p> <p>matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd</p> <p>have signed your name like an honest man.'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the</p> <p>first really clever thing the King had said that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't</p> <p>even know what they're about!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Read them,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,</p> <p>please your Majesty?' he asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on</p> <p>till you come to the end: then stop.'</p> <p></p> <p> These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--</p> <p></p> <p> `They told me you had been to her,</p> <p> And mentioned me to him:</p> <p> She gave me a good character,</p> <p> But said I could not swim.</p> <p></p> <p> He sent them word I had not gone</p> <p> (We know it to be true):</p> <p> If she should push the matter on,</p> <p> What would become of you?</p> <p></p> <p> I gave her one, they gave him two,</p> <p> You gave us three or more;</p> <p> They all returned from him to you,</p> <p> Though they were mine before.</p> <p></p> <p> If I or she should chance to be</p> <p> Involved in this affair,</p> <p> He trusts to you to set them free,</p> <p> Exactly as we were.</p> <p></p> <p> My notion was that you had been</p> <p> (Before she had this fit)</p> <p> An obstacle that came between</p> <p> Him, and ourselves, and it.</p> <p></p> <p> Don't let him know she liked them best,</p> <p> For this must ever be</p> <p> A secret, kept from all the rest,</p> <p> Between yourself and me.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'</p> <p>said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'</p> <p></p> <p> `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had</p> <p>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit</p> <p>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't</p> <p>believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'</p> <p></p> <p> The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe</p> <p>there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to</p> <p>explain the paper.</p> <p></p> <p> `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a</p> <p>world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And</p> <p>yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his</p> <p>knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some</p> <p>meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you</p> <p>can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.</p> <p>(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)</p> <p></p> <p> `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering</p> <p>over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's</p> <p>the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,</p> <p>that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to</p> <p>the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.</p> <p>Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my</p> <p>dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the</p> <p>Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off</p> <p>writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no</p> <p>mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was</p> <p>trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round</p> <p>the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and</p> <p>everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the</p> <p>King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having</p> <p>the sentence first!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't!' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</p> <p>Nobody moved.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full</p> <p>size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'</p> <p></p> <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying</p> <p>down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half</p> <p>of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on</p> <p>the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently</p> <p>brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the</p> <p>trees upon her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long</p> <p>sleep you've had!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told</p> <p>her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange</p> <p>Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and</p> <p>when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a</p> <p>curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's</p> <p>getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she</p> <p>ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</p> <p></p> <p> But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her</p> <p>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of</p> <p>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began</p> <p>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--</p> <p></p> <p> First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the</p> <p>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes</p> <p>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her</p> <p>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back</p> <p>the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and</p> <p>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place</p> <p>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little</p> <p>sister's dream.</p> <p></p> <p> The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried</p> <p>by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the</p> <p>neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as</p> <p>the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,</p> <p>and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate</p> <p>guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the</p> <p>Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once</p> <p>more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's</p> <p>slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,</p> <p>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable</p> <p>Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in</p> <p>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and</p> <p>all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only</p> <p>rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the</p> <p>reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-</p> <p>bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd</p> <p>boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and</p> <p>all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the</p> <p>confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the</p> <p>cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's</p> <p>heavy sobs.</p> <p></p> <p> Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of</p> <p>hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how</p> <p>she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and</p> <p>loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about</p> <p>her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager</p> <p>with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of</p> <p>Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their</p> <p>simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,</p> <p>remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</p> <p></p> <p> THE END</p>
ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND</p> <p></p> <p> Lewis Carroll</p> <p></p> <p> THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER I</p> <p></p> <p> Down the Rabbit-Hole</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister</p> <p>on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had</p> <p>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no</p> <p>pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'</p> <p>thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'</p> <p></p> <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,</p> <p>for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether</p> <p>the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble</p> <p>of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White</p> <p>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p> <p></p> <p> There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice</p> <p>think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to</p> <p>itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought</p> <p>it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have</p> <p>wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);</p> <p>but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-</p> <p>POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to</p> <p>her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never</p> <p>before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to</p> <p>take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the</p> <p>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop</p> <p>down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p> <p></p> <p> In another moment down went Alice after it, never once</p> <p>considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,</p> <p>and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a</p> <p>moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself</p> <p>falling down a very deep well.</p> <p></p> <p> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she</p> <p>had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to</p> <p>wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look</p> <p>down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to</p> <p>see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and</p> <p>noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;</p> <p>here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She</p> <p>took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was</p> <p>labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it</p> <p>was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing</p> <p>somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she</p> <p>fell past it.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I</p> <p>shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll</p> <p>all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,</p> <p>even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely</p> <p>true.)</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! `I</p> <p>wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.</p> <p>`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let</p> <p>me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,</p> <p>you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her</p> <p>lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good</p> <p>opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to</p> <p>listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,</p> <p>that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude</p> <p>or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,</p> <p>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to</p> <p>say.)</p> <p></p> <p> Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right</p> <p>THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the</p> <p>people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I</p> <p>think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this</p> <p>time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall</p> <p>have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.</p> <p>Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried</p> <p>to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling</p> <p>through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what</p> <p>an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll</p> <p>never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon</p> <p>began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I</p> <p>should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember</p> <p>her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were</p> <p>down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but</p> <p>you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.</p> <p>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get</p> <p>rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of</p> <p>way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do</p> <p>bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either</p> <p>question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt</p> <p>that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she</p> <p>was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very</p> <p>earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a</p> <p>bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of</p> <p>sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a</p> <p>moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her</p> <p>was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in</p> <p>sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:</p> <p>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it</p> <p>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late</p> <p>it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the</p> <p>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found</p> <p>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps</p> <p>hanging from the roof.</p> <p></p> <p> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;</p> <p>and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the</p> <p>other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,</p> <p>wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of</p> <p>solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,</p> <p>and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the</p> <p>doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or</p> <p>the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of</p> <p>them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low</p> <p>curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little</p> <p>door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key</p> <p>in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p> <p></p> <p> Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small</p> <p>passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and</p> <p>looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</p> <p>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about</p> <p>among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but</p> <p>she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if</p> <p>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of</p> <p>very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish</p> <p>I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only</p> <p>know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things</p> <p>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few</p> <p>things indeed were really impossible.</p> <p></p> <p> There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she</p> <p>went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on</p> <p>it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like</p> <p>telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which</p> <p>certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck</p> <p>of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'</p> <p>beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p> <p></p> <p> It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little</p> <p>Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look</p> <p>first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';</p> <p>for she had read several nice little histories about children who</p> <p>had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant</p> <p>things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules</p> <p>their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker</p> <p>will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your</p> <p>finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had</p> <p>never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked</p> <p>`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or</p> <p>later.</p> <p></p> <p> However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured</p> <p>to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort</p> <p>of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast</p> <p>turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished</p> <p>it off.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up</p> <p>like a telescope.'</p> <p></p> <p> And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and</p> <p>her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right</p> <p>size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.</p> <p>First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was</p> <p>going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about</p> <p>this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my</p> <p>going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be</p> <p>like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is</p> <p>like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember</p> <p>ever having seen such a thing.</p> <p></p> <p> After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided</p> <p>on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!</p> <p>when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the</p> <p>little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,</p> <p>she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it</p> <p>quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb</p> <p>up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;</p> <p>and when she had tired herself out with trying,</p> <p>the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to</p> <p>herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'</p> <p>She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very</p> <p>seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so</p> <p>severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered</p> <p>trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game</p> <p>of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious</p> <p>child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no</p> <p>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why,</p> <p>there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable</p> <p>person!'</p> <p></p> <p> Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under</p> <p>the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on</p> <p>which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.</p> <p>`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,</p> <p>I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep</p> <p>under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I</p> <p>don't care which happens!'</p> <p></p> <p> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which</p> <p>way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to</p> <p>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to</p> <p>find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally</p> <p>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the</p> <p>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,</p> <p>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the</p> <p>common way.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER II</p> <p></p> <p> The Pool of Tears</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much</p> <p>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good</p> <p>English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that</p> <p>ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her</p> <p>feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so</p> <p>far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on</p> <p>your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't</p> <p>be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself</p> <p>about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be</p> <p>kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the</p> <p>way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of</p> <p>boots every Christmas.'</p> <p></p> <p> And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.</p> <p>`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll</p> <p>seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the</p> <p>directions will look!</p> <p></p> <p> ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</p> <p> HEARTHRUG,</p> <p> NEAR THE FENDER,</p> <p> (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).</p> <p></p> <p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in</p> <p>fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took</p> <p>up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p> <p></p> <p> Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one</p> <p>side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get</p> <p>through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to</p> <p>cry again.</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great</p> <p>girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in</p> <p>this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all</p> <p>the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool</p> <p>all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the</p> <p>hall.</p> <p></p> <p> After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the</p> <p>distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p> <p>It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a</p> <p>pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the</p> <p>other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to</p> <p>himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she</p> <p>be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate</p> <p>that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit</p> <p>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,</p> <p>sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid</p> <p>gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard</p> <p>as he could go.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very</p> <p>hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:</p> <p>`Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday</p> <p>things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in</p> <p>the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this</p> <p>morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little</p> <p>different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in</p> <p>the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began</p> <p>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age</p> <p>as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of</p> <p>them.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such</p> <p>long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm</p> <p>sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,</p> <p>oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,</p> <p>and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the</p> <p>things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,</p> <p>and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!</p> <p>I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the</p> <p>Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.</p> <p>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,</p> <p>and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been</p> <p>changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'</p> <p>and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,</p> <p>and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and</p> <p>strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--</p> <p></p> <p> `How doth the little crocodile</p> <p> Improve his shining tail,</p> <p> And pour the waters of the Nile</p> <p> On every golden scale!</p> <p></p> <p> `How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p> <p> How neatly spread his claws,</p> <p> And welcome little fishes in</p> <p> With gently smiling jaws!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and</p> <p>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel</p> <p>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little</p> <p>house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so</p> <p>many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm</p> <p>Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their</p> <p>heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look</p> <p>up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I</p> <p>like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down</p> <p>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a</p> <p>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads</p> <p>down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was</p> <p>surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little</p> <p>white kid gloves while she was talking. `How CAN I have done</p> <p>that?' she thought. `I must be growing small again.' She got up</p> <p>and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,</p> <p>as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,</p> <p>and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the</p> <p>cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it</p> <p>hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p> <p></p> <p>`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at</p> <p>the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in</p> <p>existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed</p> <p>back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut</p> <p>again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as</p> <p>before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,</p> <p>`for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare</p> <p>it's too bad, that it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another</p> <p>moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first</p> <p>idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that</p> <p>case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had</p> <p>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general</p> <p>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find</p> <p>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in</p> <p>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and</p> <p>behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that</p> <p>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine</p> <p>feet high.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,</p> <p>trying to find her way out. `I shall be punished for it now, I</p> <p>suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer</p> <p>thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a</p> <p>little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at</p> <p>first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then</p> <p>she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that</p> <p>it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this</p> <p>mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should</p> <p>think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in</p> <p>trying.' So she began: `O Mouse, do you know the way out of</p> <p>this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'</p> <p>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:</p> <p>she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having</p> <p>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a</p> <p>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather</p> <p>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little</p> <p>eyes, but it said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I</p> <p>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the</p> <p>Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had</p> <p>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she</p> <p>began again: `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in</p> <p>her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the</p> <p>water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg</p> <p>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the</p> <p>poor animal's feelings. `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate</p> <p>voice. `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: `don't be</p> <p>angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:</p> <p>I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</p> <p>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,</p> <p>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so</p> <p>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and</p> <p>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital</p> <p>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,</p> <p>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt</p> <p>certain it must be really offended. `We won't talk about her any</p> <p>more if you'd rather not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end</p> <p>of his tail. `As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family</p> <p>always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear</p> <p>the name again!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the</p> <p>subject of conversation. `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'</p> <p>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: `There is</p> <p>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</p> <p>A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly</p> <p>brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and</p> <p>it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I</p> <p>can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you</p> <p>know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!</p> <p>He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the</p> <p>Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and</p> <p>making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p> <p></p> <p> So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear! Do come back</p> <p>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't</p> <p>like them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam</p> <p>slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice</p> <p>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to</p> <p>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll</p> <p>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded</p> <p>with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a</p> <p>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious</p> <p>creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the</p> <p>shore.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER III</p> <p></p> <p> A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the</p> <p>bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their</p> <p>fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and</p> <p>uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they</p> <p>had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed</p> <p>quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with</p> <p>them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had</p> <p>quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,</p> <p>and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';</p> <p>and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,</p> <p>and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no</p> <p>more to be said.</p> <p></p> <p> At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among</p> <p>them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL</p> <p>soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large</p> <p>ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes</p> <p>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad</p> <p>cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?</p> <p>This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!</p> <p>"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was</p> <p>soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been</p> <p>of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very</p> <p>politely: `Did you speak?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought you did,' said the Mouse. `--I proceed. "Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:</p> <p>and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found</p> <p>it advisable--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.</p> <p></p> <p> `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: `of course you</p> <p>know what "it" means.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said</p> <p>the Duck: `it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is,</p> <p>what did the archbishop find?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,</p> <p>`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William</p> <p>and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was</p> <p>moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you</p> <p>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it</p> <p>spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: `it doesn't</p> <p>seem to dry me at all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I</p> <p>move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more</p> <p>energetic remedies--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak English!' said the Eaglet. `I don't know the meaning of</p> <p>half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do</p> <p>either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:</p> <p>some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p> <p></p> <p> `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,</p> <p>`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much</p> <p>to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY</p> <p>ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'</p> <p>(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter</p> <p>day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p> <p></p> <p> First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the</p> <p>exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party</p> <p>were placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One,</p> <p>two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,</p> <p>and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know</p> <p>when the race was over. However, when they had been running half</p> <p>an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called</p> <p>out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,</p> <p>and asking, `But who has won?'</p> <p></p> <p> This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of</p> <p>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon</p> <p>its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,</p> <p>in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At</p> <p>last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have</p> <p>prizes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices</p> <p>asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with</p> <p>one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,</p> <p>calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand</p> <p>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt</p> <p>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</p> <p>There was exactly one a-piece all round.</p> <p></p> <p> `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have</p> <p>you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.</p> <p></p> <p> Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo</p> <p>solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of</p> <p>this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short</p> <p>speech, they all cheered.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked</p> <p>so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not</p> <p>think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,</p> <p>looking as solemn as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise</p> <p>and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not</p> <p>taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on</p> <p>the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again</p> <p>in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p> <p></p> <p> `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,</p> <p>`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half</p> <p>afraid that it would be offended again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to</p> <p>Alice, and sighing.</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with</p> <p>wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And</p> <p>she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so</p> <p>that her idea of the tale was something like this:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Fury said to a</p> <p> mouse, That he</p> <p> met in the</p> <p> house,</p> <p> "Let us</p> <p> both go to</p> <p> law: I will</p> <p> prosecute</p> <p> YOU. --Come,</p> <p> I'll take no</p> <p> denial; We</p> <p> must have a</p> <p> trial: For</p> <p> really this</p> <p> morning I've</p> <p> nothing</p> <p> to do."</p> <p> Said the</p> <p> mouse to the</p> <p> cur, "Such</p> <p> a trial,</p> <p> dear Sir,</p> <p> With</p> <p> no jury</p> <p> or judge,</p> <p> would be</p> <p> wasting</p> <p> our</p> <p> breath."</p> <p> "I'll be</p> <p> judge, I'll</p> <p> be jury,"</p> <p> Said</p> <p> cunning</p> <p> old Fury:</p> <p> "I'll</p> <p> try the</p> <p> whole</p> <p> cause,</p> <p> and</p> <p> condemn</p> <p> you</p> <p> to</p> <p> death."'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.</p> <p>`What are you thinking of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to</p> <p>the fifth bend, I think?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up</p> <p>and walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily</p> <p>offended, you know!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse only growled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after</p> <p>it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but</p> <p>the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little</p> <p>quicker.</p> <p></p> <p> `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it</p> <p>was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of</p> <p>saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you</p> <p>never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the</p> <p>young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the</p> <p>patience of an oyster!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,</p> <p>addressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'</p> <p>said the Lory.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about</p> <p>her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for</p> <p>catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her</p> <p>after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look</p> <p>at it!'</p> <p></p> <p> This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</p> <p>Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began</p> <p>wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be</p> <p>getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary</p> <p>called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my</p> <p>dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts</p> <p>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a</p> <p>melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm</p> <p>sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I</p> <p>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice</p> <p>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</p> <p>In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of</p> <p>footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping</p> <p>that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to</p> <p>finish his story.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IV</p> <p></p> <p> The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;</p> <p>and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!</p> <p>Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me</p> <p>executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have</p> <p>dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was</p> <p>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she</p> <p>very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were</p> <p>nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her</p> <p>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and</p> <p>the little door, had vanished completely.</p> <p></p> <p> Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,</p> <p>and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE</p> <p>you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of</p> <p>gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened</p> <p>that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without</p> <p>trying to explain the mistake it had made.</p> <p></p> <p> `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.</p> <p>`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd</p> <p>better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'</p> <p>As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door</p> <p>of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'</p> <p>engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried</p> <p>upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,</p> <p>and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and</p> <p>gloves.</p> <p></p> <p> `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going</p> <p>messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on</p> <p>messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that</p> <p>would happen: `"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready</p> <p>for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see</p> <p>that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went</p> <p>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering</p> <p>people about like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with</p> <p>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two</p> <p>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and</p> <p>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when</p> <p>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-</p> <p>glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'</p> <p>but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know</p> <p>SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,</p> <p>`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this</p> <p>bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for</p> <p>really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'</p> <p></p> <p> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:</p> <p>before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing</p> <p>against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being</p> <p>broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself</p> <p>`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I</p> <p>can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so</p> <p>much!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and</p> <p>growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in</p> <p>another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried</p> <p>the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the</p> <p>other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,</p> <p>as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one</p> <p>foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,</p> <p>whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'</p> <p></p> <p> Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full</p> <p>effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,</p> <p>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting</p> <p>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one</p> <p>wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about</p> <p>by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that</p> <p>rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,</p> <p>this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!</p> <p>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing</p> <p>never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There</p> <p>ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when</p> <p>I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more</p> <p>HERE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I</p> <p>am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--</p> <p>but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you</p> <p>learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no</p> <p>room at all for any lesson-books!'</p> <p></p> <p> And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,</p> <p>and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few</p> <p>minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves</p> <p>this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the</p> <p>stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and</p> <p>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she</p> <p>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no</p> <p>reason to be afraid of it.</p> <p></p> <p> Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;</p> <p>but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed</p> <p>hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it</p> <p>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she</p> <p>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly</p> <p>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not</p> <p>get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,</p> <p>and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was</p> <p>just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something</p> <p>of the sort.</p> <p></p> <p> Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are</p> <p>you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then</p> <p>I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!</p> <p>Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')</p> <p></p> <p> `An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it</p> <p>fills the whole window!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it</p> <p>away!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear</p> <p>whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer</p> <p>honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at</p> <p>last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in</p> <p>the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more</p> <p>sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there</p> <p>must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for</p> <p>pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I</p> <p>don't want to stay in here any longer!'</p> <p></p> <p> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at</p> <p>last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a</p> <p>good many voices all talking together: she made out the words:</p> <p>`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;</p> <p>Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up</p> <p>at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half</p> <p>high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--</p> <p>Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind</p> <p>that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud</p> <p>crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go</p> <p>down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,</p> <p>then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to</p> <p>go down the chimney!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said</p> <p>Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!</p> <p>I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is</p> <p>narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'</p> <p></p> <p> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and</p> <p>waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what</p> <p>sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close</p> <p>above her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one</p> <p>sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes</p> <p>Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the</p> <p>hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold</p> <p>up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?</p> <p>What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'</p> <p></p> <p> Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'</p> <p>thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm</p> <p>better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know</p> <p>is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes</p> <p>like a sky-rocket!'</p> <p></p> <p> `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and</p> <p>Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do. I'll set</p> <p>Dinah at you!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to</p> <p>herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any</p> <p>sense, they'd take the roof off.' After a minute or two, they</p> <p>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A</p> <p>barrowful will do, to begin with.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to</p> <p>doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came</p> <p>rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.</p> <p>`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,</p> <p>`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead</p> <p>silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all</p> <p>turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright</p> <p>idea came into her head. `If I eat one of these cakes,' she</p> <p>thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it</p> <p>can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I</p> <p>suppose.'</p> <p></p> <p> So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find</p> <p>that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small</p> <p>enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and</p> <p>found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.</p> <p>The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by</p> <p>two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.</p> <p>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she</p> <p>ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a</p> <p>thick wood.</p> <p></p> <p> `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she</p> <p>wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;</p> <p>and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</p> <p>I think that will be the best plan.'</p> <p></p> <p> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and</p> <p>simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the</p> <p>smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering</p> <p>about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over</p> <p>her head made her look up in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round</p> <p>eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</p> <p>`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried</p> <p>hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the</p> <p>time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it</p> <p>would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</p> <p></p> <p> Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of</p> <p>stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped</p> <p>into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,</p> <p>and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice</p> <p>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run</p> <p>over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy</p> <p>made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in</p> <p>its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very</p> <p>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every</p> <p>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle</p> <p>again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the</p> <p>stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long</p> <p>way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat</p> <p>down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its</p> <p>mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p> <p></p> <p> This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;</p> <p>so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out</p> <p>of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the</p> <p>distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she</p> <p>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself</p> <p>with one of the leaves: `I should have liked teaching it tricks</p> <p>very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh</p> <p>dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let</p> <p>me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or</p> <p>drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'</p> <p></p> <p> The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round</p> <p>her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see</p> <p>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under</p> <p>the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,</p> <p>about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under</p> <p>it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her</p> <p>that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.</p> <p></p> <p> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of</p> <p>the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large</p> <p>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,</p> <p>quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice</p> <p>of her or of anything else.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER V</p> <p></p> <p> Advice from a Caterpillar</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in</p> <p>silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice</p> <p>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--</p> <p>at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think</p> <p>I must have been changed several times since then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</p> <p>`Explain yourself!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because</p> <p>I'm not myself, you see.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very</p> <p>politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and</p> <p>being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but</p> <p>when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you</p> <p>know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll</p> <p>feel it a little queer, won't you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;</p> <p>`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. `Who are YOU?'</p> <p></p> <p> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the</p> <p>conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's</p> <p>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,</p> <p>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not</p> <p>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in</p> <p>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. `I've something</p> <p>important to say!'</p> <p></p> <p> This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as</p> <p>she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else</p> <p>to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth</p> <p>hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but</p> <p>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth</p> <p>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as</p> <p>I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it</p> <p>all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice folded her hands, and began:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,</p> <p> `And your hair has become very white;</p> <p> And yet you incessantly stand on your head--</p> <p> Do you think, at your age, it is right?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,</p> <p> `I feared it might injure the brain;</p> <p> But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,</p> <p> Why, I do it again and again.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,</p> <p> And have grown most uncommonly fat;</p> <p> Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--</p> <p> Pray, what is the reason of that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</p> <p> `I kept all my limbs very supple</p> <p> By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--</p> <p> Allow me to sell you a couple?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak</p> <p> For anything tougher than suet;</p> <p> Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--</p> <p> Pray how did you manage to do it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,</p> <p> And argued each case with my wife;</p> <p> And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,</p> <p> Has lasted the rest of my life.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose</p> <p> That your eye was as steady as ever;</p> <p> Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--</p> <p> What made you so awfully clever?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'</p> <p> Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!</p> <p> Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?</p> <p> Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the</p> <p>words have got altered.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.</p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar was the first to speak.</p> <p></p> <p> `What size do you want to be?' it asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;</p> <p>`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in</p> <p>her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you</p> <p>wouldn't mind,' said Alice: `three inches is such a wretched</p> <p>height to be.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three</p> <p>inches high).</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</p> <p>And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so</p> <p>easily offended!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it</p> <p>put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</p> <p></p> <p> This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</p> <p>In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got</p> <p>down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely</p> <p>remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and</p> <p>the other side will make you grow shorter.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had</p> <p>asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a</p> <p>minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as</p> <p>it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</p> <p>However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they</p> <p>would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p> <p></p> <p> `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a</p> <p>little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment</p> <p>she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her</p> <p>foot!</p> <p></p> <p> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but</p> <p>she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking</p> <p>rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.</p> <p>Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was</p> <p>hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and</p> <p>managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of</p> <p>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she</p> <p>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could</p> <p>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which</p> <p>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay</p> <p>far below her.</p> <p></p> <p> `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. `And where</p> <p>HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I</p> <p>can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no</p> <p>result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the</p> <p>distant green leaves.</p> <p></p> <p> As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her</p> <p>head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted</p> <p>to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,</p> <p>like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a</p> <p>graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which</p> <p>she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she</p> <p>had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a</p> <p>hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating</p> <p>her violently with its wings.</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. `Let me alone!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more</p> <p>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every</p> <p>way, and nothing seems to suit them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've</p> <p>tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but</p> <p>those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no</p> <p>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</p> <p></p> <p> `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the</p> <p>Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and</p> <p>day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was</p> <p>beginning to see its meaning.</p> <p></p> <p> `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued</p> <p>the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was</p> <p>thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come</p> <p>wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. `I'm a--I'm</p> <p>a--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're</p> <p>trying to invent something!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she</p> <p>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the</p> <p>deepest contempt. `I've seen a good many little girls in my</p> <p>time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a</p> <p>serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be</p> <p>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very</p> <p>truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as</p> <p>serpents do, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why</p> <p>then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent</p> <p>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of</p> <p>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and</p> <p>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a</p> <p>serpent?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm</p> <p>not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't</p> <p>want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it</p> <p>settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the</p> <p>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled</p> <p>among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and</p> <p>untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the</p> <p>pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very</p> <p>carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and</p> <p>growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had</p> <p>succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p> <p></p> <p> It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,</p> <p>that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a</p> <p>few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come,</p> <p>there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes</p> <p>are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to</p> <p>another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next</p> <p>thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be</p> <p>done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an</p> <p>open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</p> <p>`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come</p> <p>upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their</p> <p>wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did</p> <p>not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself</p> <p>down to nine inches high.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VI</p> <p></p> <p> Pig and Pepper</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and</p> <p>wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came</p> <p>running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman</p> <p>because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only,</p> <p>she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door</p> <p>with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,</p> <p>with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,</p> <p>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their</p> <p>heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and</p> <p>crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great</p> <p>letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to</p> <p>the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess. An</p> <p>invitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman</p> <p>repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the</p> <p>words a little, `From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess</p> <p>to play croquet.'</p> <p></p> <p> Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled</p> <p>together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into</p> <p>the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped</p> <p>out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the</p> <p>ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and</p> <p>that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the</p> <p>door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise</p> <p>inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was</p> <p>a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling</p> <p>and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish</p> <p>or kettle had been broken to pieces.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'</p> <p></p> <p> `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went</p> <p>on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us. For</p> <p>instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let</p> <p>you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time</p> <p>he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. `But</p> <p>perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so</p> <p>VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might</p> <p>answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate</p> <p>came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just</p> <p>grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees</p> <p>behind him.</p> <p></p> <p> `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,</p> <p>exactly as if nothing had happened.</p> <p></p> <p> `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. `That's the</p> <p>first question, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.</p> <p>`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the</p> <p>creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for</p> <p>repeating his remark, with variations. `I shall sit here,' he</p> <p>said, `on and off, for days and days.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what am I to do?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:</p> <p>`he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.</p> <p></p> <p> The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of</p> <p>smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a</p> <p>three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was</p> <p>leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to</p> <p>be full of soup.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to</p> <p>herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p> <p></p> <p> There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the</p> <p>Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was</p> <p>sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The</p> <p>only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,</p> <p>and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from</p> <p>ear to ear.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for</p> <p>she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to</p> <p>speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!'</p> <p></p> <p> She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice</p> <p>quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed</p> <p>to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I</p> <p>didn't know that cats COULD grin.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,</p> <p>feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</p> <p></p> <p> `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought</p> <p>it would be as well to introduce some other subject of</p> <p>conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took</p> <p>the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work</p> <p>throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby</p> <p>--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,</p> <p>plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when</p> <p>they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it</p> <p>was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up</p> <p>and down in an agony of terror. `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS</p> <p>nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very</p> <p>nearly carried it off.</p> <p></p> <p> `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a</p> <p>hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it</p> <p>does.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very</p> <p>glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her</p> <p>knowledge. `Just think of what work it would make with the day</p> <p>and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn</p> <p>round on its axis--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant</p> <p>to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and</p> <p>seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: `Twenty-four</p> <p>hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide</p> <p>figures!' And with that she began nursing her child again,</p> <p>singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a</p> <p>violent shake at the end of every line:</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak roughly to your little boy,</p> <p> And beat him when he sneezes:</p> <p> He only does it to annoy,</p> <p> Because he knows it teases.'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> (In which the cook and the baby joined):--</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept</p> <p>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing</p> <p>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I speak severely to my boy,</p> <p> I beat him when he sneezes;</p> <p> For he can thoroughly enjoy</p> <p> The pepper when he pleases!'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said</p> <p>to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. `I must go and</p> <p>get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of</p> <p>the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,</p> <p>but it just missed her.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-</p> <p>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all</p> <p>directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor</p> <p>little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,</p> <p>and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,</p> <p>so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much</p> <p>as she could do to hold it.</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,</p> <p>(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep</p> <p>tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its</p> <p>undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. `IF I</p> <p>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure</p> <p>to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it</p> <p>behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing</p> <p>grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). `Don't</p> <p>grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing</p> <p>yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into</p> <p>its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no</p> <p>doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout</p> <p>than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for</p> <p>a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at</p> <p>all. `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked</p> <p>into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</p> <p></p> <p> No, there were no tears. `If you're going to turn into a pig,</p> <p>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do</p> <p>with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or</p> <p>grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for</p> <p>some while in silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I</p> <p>to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted</p> <p>again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some</p> <p>alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was</p> <p>neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be</p> <p>quite absurd for her to carry it further.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to</p> <p>see it trot away quietly into the wood. `If it had grown up,'</p> <p>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:</p> <p>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began</p> <p>thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as</p> <p>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right</p> <p>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing</p> <p>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-</p> <p>natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great</p> <p>many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p> <p></p> <p> `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at</p> <p>all know whether it would like the name: however, it only</p> <p>grinned a little wider. `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought</p> <p>Alice, and she went on. `Would you tell me, please, which way I</p> <p>ought to go from here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said</p> <p>the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't much care where--' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk</p> <p>long enough.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another</p> <p>question. `What sort of people live about here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,</p> <p>`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,</p> <p>`lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.</p> <p>I'm mad. You're mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on</p> <p>`And how do you know that you're mad?'</p> <p></p> <p> `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad. You grant</p> <p>that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I suppose so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's</p> <p>angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm</p> <p>pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call it what you like,' said the Cat. `Do you play croquet</p> <p>with the Queen to-day?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been</p> <p>invited yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used</p> <p>to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place</p> <p>where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.</p> <p></p> <p> `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. `I'd</p> <p>nearly forgotten to ask.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had</p> <p>come back in a natural way.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it</p> <p>did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the</p> <p>direction in which the March Hare was said to live. `I've seen</p> <p>hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be</p> <p>much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be</p> <p>raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.' As she said</p> <p>this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a</p> <p>branch of a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep</p> <p>appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'</p> <p></p> <p> `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,</p> <p>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,</p> <p>which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever</p> <p>saw in my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the</p> <p>house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house,</p> <p>because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was</p> <p>thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not</p> <p>like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand</p> <p>bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even</p> <p>then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself</p> <p>`Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd</p> <p>gone to see the Hatter instead!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VII</p> <p></p> <p> A Mad Tea-Party</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,</p> <p>and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a</p> <p>Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two</p> <p>were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking</p> <p>over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p> <p></p> <p> The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded</p> <p>together at one corner of it: `No room! No room!' they cried</p> <p>out when they saw Alice coming. `There's PLENTY of room!' said</p> <p>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one</p> <p>end of the table.</p> <p></p> <p> `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it</p> <p>but tea. `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice</p> <p>angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being</p> <p>invited,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a</p> <p>great many more than three.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been</p> <p>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was</p> <p>his first speech.</p> <p></p> <p> `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said</p> <p>with some severity; `it's very rude.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all</p> <p>he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. `I'm glad</p> <p>they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she</p> <p>added aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'</p> <p>said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what</p> <p>I say--that's the same thing, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. `You might just</p> <p>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat</p> <p>what I see"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I</p> <p>like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to</p> <p>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the</p> <p>same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the</p> <p>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,</p> <p>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and</p> <p>writing-desks, which wasn't much.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter was the first to break the silence. `What day of</p> <p>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his</p> <p>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking</p> <p>it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. `I told you butter</p> <p>wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March</p> <p>Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter</p> <p>grumbled: `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'</p> <p></p> <p> The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then</p> <p>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he</p> <p>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It</p> <p>was the BEST butter, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</p> <p>`What a funny watch!' she remarked. `It tells the day of the</p> <p>month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. `Does YOUR watch tell</p> <p>you what year it is?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: `but that's</p> <p>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to</p> <p>have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</p> <p>`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she</p> <p>could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured</p> <p>a little hot tea upon its nose.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without</p> <p>opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to</p> <p>remark myself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to</p> <p>Alice again.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I give it up,' Alice replied: `what's the answer?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nor I,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice sighed wearily. `I think you might do something better</p> <p>with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that</p> <p>have no answers.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you</p> <p>wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head</p> <p>contemptuously. `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: `but I know I have to</p> <p>beat time when I learn music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. `He won't stand</p> <p>beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do</p> <p>almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose</p> <p>it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:</p> <p>you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the</p> <p>clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'</p> <p></p> <p> (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a</p> <p>whisper.)</p> <p></p> <p> `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:</p> <p>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: `but you could keep</p> <p>it to half-past one as long as you liked.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter shook his head mournfully. `Not I!' he replied.</p> <p>`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'</p> <p>(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the</p> <p>great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing</p> <p></p> <p> "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</p> <p> How I wonder what you're at!"</p> <p></p> <p>You know the song, perhaps?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--</p> <p></p> <p> "Up above the world you fly,</p> <p> Like a tea-tray in the sky.</p> <p> Twinkle, twinkle--"'</p> <p></p> <p>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep</p> <p>`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that</p> <p>they had to pinch it to make it stop.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,</p> <p>`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the</p> <p>time! Off with his head!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,</p> <p>`he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'</p> <p></p> <p> A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so</p> <p>many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always</p> <p>tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice</p> <p>ventured to ask.</p> <p></p> <p> `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,</p> <p>yawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady</p> <p>tells us a story.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at</p> <p>the proposal.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. `Wake up,</p> <p>Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. `I wasn't asleep,' he</p> <p>said in a hoarse, feeble voice: `I heard every word you fellows</p> <p>were saying.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep</p> <p>again before it's done.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the</p> <p>Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,</p> <p>Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great</p> <p>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</p> <p></p> <p> `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a</p> <p>minute or two.</p> <p></p> <p> `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently</p> <p>remarked; `they'd have been ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways</p> <p>of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went</p> <p>on: `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very</p> <p>earnestly.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so</p> <p>I can't take more.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very</p> <p>easy to take MORE than nothing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked</p> <p>triumphantly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped</p> <p>herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the</p> <p>Dormouse, and repeated her question. `Why did they live at the</p> <p>bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and</p> <p>then said, `It was a treacle-well.'</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but</p> <p>the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse</p> <p>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the</p> <p>story for yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt</p> <p>again. I dare say there may be ONE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he</p> <p>consented to go on. `And so these three little sisters--they</p> <p>were learning to draw, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this</p> <p>time.</p> <p></p> <p> `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: `let's all move</p> <p>one place on.'</p> <p></p> <p> He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the</p> <p>March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather</p> <p>unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the</p> <p>only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a</p> <p>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset</p> <p>the milk-jug into his plate.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began</p> <p>very cautiously: `But I don't understand. Where did they draw</p> <p>the treacle from?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so</p> <p>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,</p> <p>stupid?'</p> <p></p> <p> `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not</p> <p>choosing to notice this last remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'</p> <p></p> <p> This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse</p> <p>go on for some time without interrupting it.</p> <p></p> <p> `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and</p> <p>rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew</p> <p>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why with an M?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why not?' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going</p> <p>off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up</p> <p>again with a little shriek, and went on: `--that begins with an</p> <p>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--</p> <p>you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever</p> <p>see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I</p> <p>don't think--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got</p> <p>up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep</p> <p>instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her</p> <p>going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that</p> <p>they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were</p> <p>trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</p> <p></p> <p> `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she</p> <p>picked her way through the wood. `It's the stupidest tea-party I</p> <p>ever was at in all my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a</p> <p>door leading right into it. `That's very curious!' she thought.</p> <p>`But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.'</p> <p>And in she went.</p> <p></p> <p> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the</p> <p>little glass table. `Now, I'll manage better this time,'</p> <p>she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,</p> <p>and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went</p> <p>to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it</p> <p>in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down</p> <p>the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the</p> <p>beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VIII</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's Croquet-Ground</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the</p> <p>roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at</p> <p>it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious</p> <p>thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up</p> <p>to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go</p> <p>splashing paint over me like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged</p> <p>my elbow.'</p> <p></p> <p> On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always</p> <p>lay the blame on others!'</p> <p></p> <p> `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. `I heard the Queen say only</p> <p>yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it</p> <p>was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'</p> <p></p> <p> Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all</p> <p>the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as</p> <p>she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the</p> <p>others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are</p> <p>painting those roses?'</p> <p></p> <p> Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a</p> <p>low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to</p> <p>have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;</p> <p>and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads</p> <p>cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore</p> <p>she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously</p> <p>looking across the garden, called out `The Queen! The Queen!'</p> <p>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon</p> <p>their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice</p> <p>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped</p> <p>like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and</p> <p>feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were</p> <p>ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the</p> <p>soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were</p> <p>ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand</p> <p>in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next</p> <p>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice</p> <p>recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous</p> <p>manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without</p> <p>noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the</p> <p>King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this</p> <p>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on</p> <p>her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember</p> <p>ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,</p> <p>what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people</p> <p>had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'</p> <p>So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p> <p></p> <p> When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped</p> <p>and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'</p> <p>She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,</p> <p>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'</p> <p></p> <p> `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very</p> <p>politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of</p> <p>cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three</p> <p>gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as</p> <p>they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs</p> <p>was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether</p> <p>they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her</p> <p>own children.</p> <p></p> <p> `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</p> <p>`It's no business of MINE.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her</p> <p>for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!</p> <p>Off--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the</p> <p>Queen was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said</p> <p>`Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave</p> <p>`Turn them over!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p> <p></p> <p> `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the</p> <p>three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the</p> <p>King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</p> <p></p> <p> `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. `You make me giddy.'</p> <p>And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you</p> <p>been doing here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,</p> <p>going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the</p> <p>roses. `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,</p> <p>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate</p> <p>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</p> <p></p> <p> `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a</p> <p>large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered</p> <p>about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly</p> <p>marched off after the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers</p> <p>shouted in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's right!' shouted the Queen. `Can you play croquet?'</p> <p></p> <p> The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question</p> <p>was evidently meant for her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes!' shouted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the</p> <p>procession, wondering very much what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.</p> <p>She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously</p> <p>into her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very,' said Alice: `--where's the Duchess?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He</p> <p>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised</p> <p>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and</p> <p>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I didn't,' said Alice: `I don't think it's at all a pity.</p> <p>I said "What for?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a</p> <p>little scream of laughter. `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a</p> <p>frightened tone. `The Queen will hear you! You see, she came</p> <p>rather late, and the Queen said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,</p> <p>and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up</p> <p>against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or</p> <p>two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a</p> <p>curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and</p> <p>furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live</p> <p>flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to</p> <p>stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p> <p></p> <p> The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her</p> <p>flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,</p> <p>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,</p> <p>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened</p> <p>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it</p> <p>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a</p> <p>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:</p> <p>and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,</p> <p>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled</p> <p>itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,</p> <p>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she</p> <p>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers</p> <p>were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the</p> <p>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very</p> <p>difficult game indeed.</p> <p></p> <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns,</p> <p>quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in</p> <p>a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went</p> <p>stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with</p> <p>her head!' about once in a minute.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as</p> <p>yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might</p> <p>happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of</p> <p>me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great</p> <p>wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'</p> <p></p> <p> She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering</p> <p>whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a</p> <p>curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at</p> <p>first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to</p> <p>be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat: now I</p> <p>shall have somebody to talk to.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was</p> <p>mouth enough for it to speak with.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. `It's no</p> <p>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at</p> <p>least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared,</p> <p>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the</p> <p>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The</p> <p>Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and</p> <p>no more of it appeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather</p> <p>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't</p> <p>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in</p> <p>particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and</p> <p>you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;</p> <p>for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next</p> <p>walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have</p> <p>croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it</p> <p>saw mine coming!'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at all,' said Alice: `she's so extremely--' Just then</p> <p>she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so</p> <p>she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while</p> <p>finishing the game.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen smiled and passed on.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and</p> <p>looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: `allow me</p> <p>to introduce it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:</p> <p>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me</p> <p>like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. `I've read that in</p> <p>some book, but I don't remember where.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and</p> <p>he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear! I</p> <p>wish you would have this cat removed!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great</p> <p>or small. `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking</p> <p>round.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and</p> <p>he hurried off.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game</p> <p>was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,</p> <p>screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three</p> <p>of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and</p> <p>she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in</p> <p>such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or</p> <p>not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p> <p></p> <p> The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,</p> <p>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one</p> <p>of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her</p> <p>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where</p> <p>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up</p> <p>into a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,</p> <p>the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:</p> <p>`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches</p> <p>are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away</p> <p>under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for</p> <p>a little more conversation with her friend.</p> <p></p> <p> When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to</p> <p>find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute</p> <p>going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who</p> <p>were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,</p> <p>and looked very uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to</p> <p>settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,</p> <p>though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed</p> <p>to make out exactly what they said.</p> <p></p> <p> The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a</p> <p>head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had</p> <p>never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin</p> <p>at HIS time of life.</p> <p></p> <p> The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be</p> <p>beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about</p> <p>it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.</p> <p>(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so</p> <p>grave and anxious.)</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the</p> <p>Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: `fetch</p> <p>her here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,</p> <p>by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely</p> <p>disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down</p> <p>looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IX</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle's Story</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old</p> <p>thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately</p> <p>into Alice's, and they walked off together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and</p> <p>thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had</p> <p>made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p> `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very</p> <p>hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT</p> <p>ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that</p> <p>makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at</p> <p>having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them</p> <p>sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar</p> <p>and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish</p> <p>people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you</p> <p>know--'</p> <p></p> <p> She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a</p> <p>little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</p> <p>`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you</p> <p>forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that</p> <p>is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. `Everything's got a</p> <p>moral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up</p> <p>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first,</p> <p>because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was</p> <p>exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,</p> <p>and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not</p> <p>like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of</p> <p>keeping up the conversation a little.</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis so,' said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--"Oh,</p> <p>'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody</p> <p>minding their own business!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,</p> <p>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,</p> <p>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the</p> <p>sounds will take care of themselves."'</p> <p></p> <p> `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your</p> <p>waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I'm</p> <p>doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the</p> <p>experiment?'</p> <p></p> <p> `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all</p> <p>anxious to have the experiment tried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very true,' said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both</p> <p>bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock</p> <p>together."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: `what a clear way you</p> <p>have of putting things!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree</p> <p>to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near</p> <p>here. And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the</p> <p>less there is of yours."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this</p> <p>last remark, `it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it</p> <p>is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of</p> <p>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put</p> <p>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than</p> <p>what it might appear to others that what you were or might have</p> <p>been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared</p> <p>to them to be otherwise."'</p> <p></p> <p> `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very</p> <p>politely, `if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it</p> <p>as you say it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess</p> <p>replied, in a pleased tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'</p> <p>said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. `I make you</p> <p>a present of everything I've said as yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. `I'm glad they don't</p> <p>give birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to</p> <p>say it out loud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her</p> <p>sharp little chin.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was</p> <p>beginning to feel a little worried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;</p> <p>and the m--'</p> <p></p> <p> But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died</p> <p>away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the</p> <p>arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up,</p> <p>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,</p> <p>frowning like a thunderstorm.</p> <p></p> <p> `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on</p> <p>the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,</p> <p>and that in about half no time! Take your choice!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p> <p></p> <p> `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice</p> <p>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her</p> <p>back to the croquet-ground.</p> <p></p> <p> The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,</p> <p>and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her,</p> <p>they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a</p> <p>moment's delay would cost them their lives.</p> <p></p> <p> All the time they were playing the Queen never left off</p> <p>quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his</p> <p>head!' or `Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were</p> <p>taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave</p> <p>off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour</p> <p>or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the</p> <p>King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of</p> <p>execution.</p> <p></p> <p> Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to</p> <p>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said Alice. `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his</p> <p>history,'</p> <p></p> <p> As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low</p> <p>voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.' `Come,</p> <p>THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite</p> <p>unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p> <p></p> <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the</p> <p>sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)</p> <p>`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to</p> <p>see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and</p> <p>see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,</p> <p>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like</p> <p>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would</p> <p>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage</p> <p>Queen: so she waited.</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the</p> <p>Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!'</p> <p>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the fun?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. `It's all her fancy, that: they</p> <p>never executes nobody, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went</p> <p>slowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life,</p> <p>never!'</p> <p></p> <p> They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the</p> <p>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,</p> <p>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart</p> <p>would break. She pitied him deeply. `What is his sorrow?' she</p> <p>asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the</p> <p>same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got</p> <p>no sorrow, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with</p> <p>large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to</p> <p>know your history, she do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow</p> <p>tone: `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've</p> <p>finished.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice</p> <p>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he</p> <p>doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.</p> <p></p> <p> `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was</p> <p>a real Turtle.'</p> <p></p> <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only</p> <p>by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and</p> <p>the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very</p> <p>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your</p> <p>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be</p> <p>more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more</p> <p>calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to</p> <p>school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call</p> <p>him Tortoise--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle angrily: `really you are very dull!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple</p> <p>question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and</p> <p>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At</p> <p>last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!</p> <p>Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe</p> <p>it--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak</p> <p>again. The Mock Turtle went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school</p> <p>every day--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be</p> <p>so proud as all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle in a tone of great relief. `Now at OURS they had at the</p> <p>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'</p> <p></p> <p> `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the</p> <p>bottom of the sea.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a</p> <p>sigh. `I only took the regular course.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was that?' inquired Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock</p> <p>Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--</p> <p>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. `What is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. `What! Never</p> <p>heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. `You know what to beautify is,</p> <p>I suppose?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to</p> <p>uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about</p> <p>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you</p> <p>to learn?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting</p> <p>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,</p> <p>with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old</p> <p>conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us</p> <p>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was THAT like?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: `I'm</p> <p>too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics</p> <p>master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he</p> <p>taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;</p> <p>and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a</p> <p>hurry to change the subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the</p> <p>next, and so on.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon</p> <p>remarked: `because they lessen from day to day.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a</p> <p>little before she made her next remark. `Then the eleventh day</p> <p>must have been a holiday?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a</p> <p>very decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER X</p> <p></p> <p> The Lobster Quadrille</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper</p> <p>across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for</p> <p>a minute or two sobs choked his voice. `Same as if he had a bone</p> <p>in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him</p> <p>and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered</p> <p>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--</p> <p>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'</p> <p>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,</p> <p>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful</p> <p>thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, indeed,' said Alice. `What sort of a dance is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;</p> <p>then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `--you advance twice--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: `advance twice, set to</p> <p>partners--'</p> <p></p> <p> `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the</p> <p>Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</p> <p></p> <p> `--as far out to sea as you can--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,</p> <p>capering wildly about.</p> <p></p> <p> `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the</p> <p>Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,</p> <p>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat</p> <p>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very much indeed,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the</p> <p>Gryphon. `We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall</p> <p>sing?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. `I've forgotten the words.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now</p> <p>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and</p> <p>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle</p> <p>sang this, very slowly and sadly:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>`"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.</p> <p>"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my</p> <p> tail.</p> <p>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</p> <p>They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be</p> <p>When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to</p> <p> sea!"</p> <p>But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look</p> <p> askance--</p> <p>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the</p> <p> dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p></p> <p>`"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.</p> <p>"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.</p> <p>The further off from England the nearer is to France--</p> <p>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</p> <p></p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p> dance?</p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p> dance?"'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said</p> <p>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: `and I do so</p> <p>like that curious song about the whiting!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've</p> <p>seen them, of course?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she</p> <p>checked herself hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but</p> <p>if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're</p> <p>like.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. `They have their</p> <p>tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:</p> <p>`crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails</p> <p>in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle</p> <p>yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all</p> <p>that,' he said to the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with</p> <p>the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So</p> <p>they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in</p> <p>their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting. I never knew</p> <p>so much about a whiting before.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the</p> <p>Gryphon. `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never thought about it,' said Alice. `Why?'</p> <p></p> <p> `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very</p> <p>solemnly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was thoroughly puzzled. `Does the boots and shoes!' she</p> <p>repeated in a wondering tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. `I</p> <p>mean, what makes them so shiny?'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she</p> <p>gave her answer. `They're done with blacking, I believe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep</p> <p>voice, `are done with a whiting. Now you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great</p> <p>curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather</p> <p>impatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were</p> <p>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep</p> <p>back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>said: `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came</p> <p>to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With</p> <p>what porpoise?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended</p> <p>tone. And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR</p> <p>adventures.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'</p> <p>said Alice a little timidly: `but it's no use going back to</p> <p>yesterday, because I was a different person then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an</p> <p>impatient tone: `explanations take such a dreadful time.'</p> <p></p> <p> So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when</p> <p>she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about</p> <p>it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on</p> <p>each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she</p> <p>gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly</p> <p>quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,</p> <p>FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming</p> <p>different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said</p> <p>`That's very curious.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated</p> <p>thoughtfully. `I should like to hear her try and repeat</p> <p>something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as</p> <p>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said</p> <p>the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat</p> <p>lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'</p> <p>However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so</p> <p>full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was</p> <p>saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,</p> <p> "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."</p> <p> As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose</p> <p> Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,</p> <p> And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,</p> <p> But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,</p> <p> His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]</p> <p></p> <p> `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'</p> <p>said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it</p> <p>sounds uncommon nonsense.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her</p> <p>hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. `Go on with</p> <p>the next verse.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. `How COULD</p> <p>he turn them out with his nose, you know?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was</p> <p>dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the</p> <p>subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:</p> <p>`it begins "I passed by his garden."'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would</p> <p>all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,</p> <p> How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,</p> <p> While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</p> <p> When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,</p> <p> Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:</p> <p> While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,</p> <p> And concluded the banquet--]</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far</p> <p>the most confusing thing I ever heard!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and</p> <p>Alice was only too glad to do so.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the</p> <p>Gryphon went on. `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you</p> <p>a song?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'</p> <p>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather</p> <p>offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her</p> <p>"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes</p> <p>choked with sobs, to sing this:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</p> <p> Waiting in a hot tureen!</p> <p> Who for such dainties would not stoop?</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,</p> <p> Game, or any other dish?</p> <p> Who would not give all else for two</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had</p> <p>just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'</p> <p>was heard in the distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,</p> <p>it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</p> <p></p> <p> `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon</p> <p>only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more</p> <p>faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the</p> <p>melancholy words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XI</p> <p></p> <p> Who Stole the Tarts?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when</p> <p>they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts</p> <p>of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:</p> <p>the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on</p> <p>each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,</p> <p>with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the</p> <p>other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large</p> <p>dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice</p> <p>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'</p> <p>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed</p> <p>to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about</p> <p>her, to pass away the time.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had</p> <p>read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that</p> <p>she knew the name of nearly everything there. `That's the</p> <p>judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'</p> <p></p> <p> The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown</p> <p>over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he</p> <p>did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly</p> <p>not becoming.</p> <p></p> <p> `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve</p> <p>creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because</p> <p>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they</p> <p>are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over</p> <p>to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and</p> <p>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the</p> <p>meaning of it at all. However, `jury-men' would have done just</p> <p>as well.</p> <p></p> <p> The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</p> <p>`What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. `They</p> <p>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in</p> <p>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the</p> <p>trial.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but</p> <p>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in</p> <p>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked</p> <p>anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their</p> <p>shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'</p> <p>on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them</p> <p>didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his</p> <p>neighbour to tell him. `A nice muddle their slates'll be in</p> <p>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,</p> <p>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got</p> <p>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it</p> <p>away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was</p> <p>Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of</p> <p>it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write</p> <p>with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very</p> <p>little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p> <p></p> <p> `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and</p> <p>then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--</p> <p></p> <p> `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,</p> <p> All on a summer day:</p> <p> The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,</p> <p> And took them quite away!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. `There's</p> <p>a great deal to come before that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit</p> <p>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First</p> <p>witness!'</p> <p></p> <p> The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in</p> <p>one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. `I beg</p> <p>pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in: but I</p> <p>hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to have finished,' said the King. `When did you</p> <p>begin?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into</p> <p>the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. `Fourteenth of March, I</p> <p>think it was,' he said.</p> <p></p> <p> `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury</p> <p>eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then</p> <p>added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</p> <p></p> <p> `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who</p> <p>instantly made a memorandum of the fact.</p> <p></p> <p> `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;</p> <p>`I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'</p> <p></p> <p> Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or</p> <p>I'll have you executed on the spot.'</p> <p></p> <p> This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept</p> <p>shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the</p> <p>Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his</p> <p>teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.</p> <p></p> <p> Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which</p> <p>puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was</p> <p>beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she</p> <p>would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she</p> <p>decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for</p> <p>her.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was</p> <p>sitting next to her. `I can hardly breathe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: `I'm growing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: `you know</p> <p>you're growing too.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:</p> <p>`not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily</p> <p>and crossed over to the other side of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to</p> <p>one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the</p> <p>singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter</p> <p>trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have</p> <p>you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a</p> <p>trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week</p> <p>or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and</p> <p>the twinkling of the tea--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.</p> <p>`Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things</p> <p>twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did!' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `I deny it!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `He denies it,' said the King: `leave out that part.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,</p> <p>looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the</p> <p>Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</p> <p></p> <p> `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-</p> <p>and-butter--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you</p> <p>executed.'</p> <p></p> <p> The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,</p> <p>and went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he</p> <p>began.</p> <p></p> <p> `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately</p> <p>suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a</p> <p>hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had</p> <p>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:</p> <p>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat</p> <p>upon it.)</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've so often</p> <p>read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some</p> <p>attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the</p> <p>officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant</p> <p>till now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'</p> <p>continued the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as</p> <p>it is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.</p> <p></p> <p> Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. `Now we</p> <p>shall get on better.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious</p> <p>look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</p> <p></p> <p> `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the</p> <p>court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.</p> <p></p> <p> `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one</p> <p>of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the</p> <p>officer could get to the door.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the next witness!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the</p> <p>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before</p> <p>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began</p> <p>sneezing all at once.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shan't,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a</p> <p>low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy</p> <p>air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till</p> <p>his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What</p> <p>are tarts made of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead that</p> <p>Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch</p> <p>him! Off with his whiskers!'</p> <p></p> <p> For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the</p> <p>Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down</p> <p>again, the cook had disappeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.</p> <p>`Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the</p> <p>Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.</p> <p>It quite makes my forehead ache!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,</p> <p>feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,</p> <p>`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.</p> <p>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top</p> <p>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XII</p> <p></p> <p> Alice's Evidence</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the</p> <p>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she</p> <p>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with</p> <p>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads</p> <p>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding</p> <p>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset</p> <p>the week before.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great</p> <p>dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,</p> <p>for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and</p> <p>she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once</p> <p>and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</p> <p></p> <p> `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave</p> <p>voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--</p> <p>ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as</p> <p>he said do.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she</p> <p>had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing</p> <p>was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable</p> <p>to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that</p> <p>it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it</p> <p>would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of</p> <p>being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and</p> <p>handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write</p> <p>out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed</p> <p>too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,</p> <p>gazing up into the roof of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you know about this business?' the King said to</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.</p> <p>They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when</p> <p>the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,</p> <p>of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and</p> <p>making faces at him as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and</p> <p>went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--</p> <p>unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word</p> <p>sounded best.</p> <p></p> <p> Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some</p> <p>`unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to</p> <p>look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she</p> <p>thought to herself.</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily</p> <p>writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out</p> <p>from his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE</p> <p>HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'</p> <p></p> <p> Everybody looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You are,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides,</p> <p>that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</p> <p>`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said</p> <p>the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has</p> <p>just been picked up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What's in it?' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems</p> <p>to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was</p> <p>written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,</p> <p>there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper</p> <p>as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set</p> <p>of verses.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of</p> <p>the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the</p> <p>queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)</p> <p></p> <p> `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.</p> <p>(The jury all brightened up again.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and</p> <p>they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the</p> <p>matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd</p> <p>have signed your name like an honest man.'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the</p> <p>first really clever thing the King had said that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't</p> <p>even know what they're about!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Read them,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,</p> <p>please your Majesty?' he asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on</p> <p>till you come to the end: then stop.'</p> <p></p> <p> These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--</p> <p></p> <p> `They told me you had been to her,</p> <p> And mentioned me to him:</p> <p> She gave me a good character,</p> <p> But said I could not swim.</p> <p></p> <p> He sent them word I had not gone</p> <p> (We know it to be true):</p> <p> If she should push the matter on,</p> <p> What would become of you?</p> <p></p> <p> I gave her one, they gave him two,</p> <p> You gave us three or more;</p> <p> They all returned from him to you,</p> <p> Though they were mine before.</p> <p></p> <p> If I or she should chance to be</p> <p> Involved in this affair,</p> <p> He trusts to you to set them free,</p> <p> Exactly as we were.</p> <p></p> <p> My notion was that you had been</p> <p> (Before she had this fit)</p> <p> An obstacle that came between</p> <p> Him, and ourselves, and it.</p> <p></p> <p> Don't let him know she liked them best,</p> <p> For this must ever be</p> <p> A secret, kept from all the rest,</p> <p> Between yourself and me.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'</p> <p>said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'</p> <p></p> <p> `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had</p> <p>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit</p> <p>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't</p> <p>believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'</p> <p></p> <p> The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe</p> <p>there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to</p> <p>explain the paper.</p> <p></p> <p> `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a</p> <p>world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And</p> <p>yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his</p> <p>knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some</p> <p>meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you</p> <p>can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.</p> <p>(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)</p> <p></p> <p> `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering</p> <p>over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's</p> <p>the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,</p> <p>that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to</p> <p>the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.</p> <p>Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my</p> <p>dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the</p> <p>Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off</p> <p>writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no</p> <p>mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was</p> <p>trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round</p> <p>the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and</p> <p>everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the</p> <p>King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having</p> <p>the sentence first!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't!' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</p> <p>Nobody moved.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full</p> <p>size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'</p> <p></p> <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying</p> <p>down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half</p> <p>of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on</p> <p>the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently</p> <p>brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the</p> <p>trees upon her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long</p> <p>sleep you've had!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told</p> <p>her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange</p> <p>Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and</p> <p>when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a</p> <p>curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's</p> <p>getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she</p> <p>ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</p> <p></p> <p> But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her</p> <p>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of</p> <p>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began</p> <p>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--</p> <p></p> <p> First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the</p> <p>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes</p> <p>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her</p> <p>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back</p> <p>the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and</p> <p>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place</p> <p>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little</p> <p>sister's dream.</p> <p></p> <p> The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried</p> <p>by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the</p> <p>neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as</p> <p>the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,</p> <p>and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate</p> <p>guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the</p> <p>Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once</p> <p>more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's</p> <p>slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,</p> <p>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable</p> <p>Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in</p> <p>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and</p> <p>all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only</p> <p>rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the</p> <p>reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-</p> <p>bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd</p> <p>boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and</p> <p>all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the</p> <p>confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the</p> <p>cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's</p> <p>heavy sobs.</p> <p></p> <p> Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of</p> <p>hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how</p> <p>she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and</p> <p>loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about</p> <p>her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager</p> <p>with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of</p> <p>Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their</p> <p>simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,</p> <p>remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</p> <p></p> <p> THE END</p>
ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND</p> <p></p> <p> Lewis Carroll</p> <p></p> <p> THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER I</p> <p></p> <p> Down the Rabbit-Hole</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister</p> <p>on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had</p> <p>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no</p> <p>pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'</p> <p>thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'</p> <p></p> <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,</p> <p>for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether</p> <p>the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble</p> <p>of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White</p> <p>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p> <p></p> <p> There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice</p> <p>think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to</p> <p>itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought</p> <p>it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have</p> <p>wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);</p> <p>but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-</p> <p>POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to</p> <p>her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never</p> <p>before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to</p> <p>take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the</p> <p>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop</p> <p>down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p> <p></p> <p> In another moment down went Alice after it, never once</p> <p>considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,</p> <p>and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a</p> <p>moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself</p> <p>falling down a very deep well.</p> <p></p> <p> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she</p> <p>had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to</p> <p>wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look</p> <p>down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to</p> <p>see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and</p> <p>noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;</p> <p>here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She</p> <p>took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was</p> <p>labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it</p> <p>was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing</p> <p>somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she</p> <p>fell past it.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I</p> <p>shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll</p> <p>all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,</p> <p>even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely</p> <p>true.)</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! `I</p> <p>wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.</p> <p>`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let</p> <p>me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,</p> <p>you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her</p> <p>lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good</p> <p>opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to</p> <p>listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,</p> <p>that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude</p> <p>or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,</p> <p>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to</p> <p>say.)</p> <p></p> <p> Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right</p> <p>THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the</p> <p>people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I</p> <p>think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this</p> <p>time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall</p> <p>have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.</p> <p>Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried</p> <p>to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling</p> <p>through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what</p> <p>an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll</p> <p>never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon</p> <p>began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I</p> <p>should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember</p> <p>her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were</p> <p>down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but</p> <p>you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.</p> <p>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get</p> <p>rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of</p> <p>way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do</p> <p>bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either</p> <p>question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt</p> <p>that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she</p> <p>was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very</p> <p>earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a</p> <p>bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of</p> <p>sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a</p> <p>moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her</p> <p>was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in</p> <p>sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:</p> <p>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it</p> <p>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late</p> <p>it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the</p> <p>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found</p> <p>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps</p> <p>hanging from the roof.</p> <p></p> <p> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;</p> <p>and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the</p> <p>other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,</p> <p>wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of</p> <p>solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,</p> <p>and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the</p> <p>doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or</p> <p>the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of</p> <p>them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low</p> <p>curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little</p> <p>door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key</p> <p>in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p> <p></p> <p> Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small</p> <p>passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and</p> <p>looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</p> <p>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about</p> <p>among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but</p> <p>she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if</p> <p>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of</p> <p>very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish</p> <p>I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only</p> <p>know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things</p> <p>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few</p> <p>things indeed were really impossible.</p> <p></p> <p> There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she</p> <p>went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on</p> <p>it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like</p> <p>telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which</p> <p>certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck</p> <p>of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'</p> <p>beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p> <p></p> <p> It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little</p> <p>Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look</p> <p>first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';</p> <p>for she had read several nice little histories about children who</p> <p>had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant</p> <p>things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules</p> <p>their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker</p> <p>will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your</p> <p>finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had</p> <p>never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked</p> <p>`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or</p> <p>later.</p> <p></p> <p> However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured</p> <p>to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort</p> <p>of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast</p> <p>turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished</p> <p>it off.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up</p> <p>like a telescope.'</p> <p></p> <p> And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and</p> <p>her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right</p> <p>size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.</p> <p>First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was</p> <p>going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about</p> <p>this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my</p> <p>going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be</p> <p>like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is</p> <p>like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember</p> <p>ever having seen such a thing.</p> <p></p> <p> After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided</p> <p>on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!</p> <p>when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the</p> <p>little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,</p> <p>she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it</p> <p>quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb</p> <p>up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;</p> <p>and when she had tired herself out with trying,</p> <p>the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to</p> <p>herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'</p> <p>She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very</p> <p>seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so</p> <p>severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered</p> <p>trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game</p> <p>of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious</p> <p>child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no</p> <p>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why,</p> <p>there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable</p> <p>person!'</p> <p></p> <p> Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under</p> <p>the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on</p> <p>which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.</p> <p>`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,</p> <p>I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep</p> <p>under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I</p> <p>don't care which happens!'</p> <p></p> <p> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which</p> <p>way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to</p> <p>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to</p> <p>find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally</p> <p>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the</p> <p>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,</p> <p>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the</p> <p>common way.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER II</p> <p></p> <p> The Pool of Tears</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much</p> <p>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good</p> <p>English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that</p> <p>ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her</p> <p>feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so</p> <p>far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on</p> <p>your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't</p> <p>be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself</p> <p>about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be</p> <p>kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the</p> <p>way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of</p> <p>boots every Christmas.'</p> <p></p> <p> And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.</p> <p>`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll</p> <p>seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the</p> <p>directions will look!</p> <p></p> <p> ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</p> <p> HEARTHRUG,</p> <p> NEAR THE FENDER,</p> <p> (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).</p> <p></p> <p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in</p> <p>fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took</p> <p>up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p> <p></p> <p> Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one</p> <p>side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get</p> <p>through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to</p> <p>cry again.</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great</p> <p>girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in</p> <p>this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all</p> <p>the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool</p> <p>all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the</p> <p>hall.</p> <p></p> <p> After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the</p> <p>distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p> <p>It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a</p> <p>pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the</p> <p>other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to</p> <p>himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she</p> <p>be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate</p> <p>that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit</p> <p>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,</p> <p>sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid</p> <p>gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard</p> <p>as he could go.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very</p> <p>hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:</p> <p>`Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday</p> <p>things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in</p> <p>the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this</p> <p>morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little</p> <p>different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in</p> <p>the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began</p> <p>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age</p> <p>as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of</p> <p>them.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such</p> <p>long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm</p> <p>sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,</p> <p>oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,</p> <p>and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the</p> <p>things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,</p> <p>and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!</p> <p>I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the</p> <p>Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.</p> <p>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,</p> <p>and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been</p> <p>changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'</p> <p>and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,</p> <p>and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and</p> <p>strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--</p> <p></p> <p> `How doth the little crocodile</p> <p> Improve his shining tail,</p> <p> And pour the waters of the Nile</p> <p> On every golden scale!</p> <p></p> <p> `How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p> <p> How neatly spread his claws,</p> <p> And welcome little fishes in</p> <p> With gently smiling jaws!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and</p> <p>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel</p> <p>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little</p> <p>house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so</p> <p>many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm</p> <p>Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their</p> <p>heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look</p> <p>up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I</p> <p>like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down</p> <p>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a</p> <p>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads</p> <p>down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was</p> <p>surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little</p> <p>white kid gloves while she was talking. `How CAN I have done</p> <p>that?' she thought. `I must be growing small again.' She got up</p> <p>and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,</p> <p>as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,</p> <p>and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the</p> <p>cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it</p> <p>hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p> <p></p> <p>`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at</p> <p>the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in</p> <p>existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed</p> <p>back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut</p> <p>again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as</p> <p>before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,</p> <p>`for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare</p> <p>it's too bad, that it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another</p> <p>moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first</p> <p>idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that</p> <p>case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had</p> <p>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general</p> <p>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find</p> <p>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in</p> <p>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and</p> <p>behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that</p> <p>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine</p> <p>feet high.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,</p> <p>trying to find her way out. `I shall be punished for it now, I</p> <p>suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer</p> <p>thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a</p> <p>little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at</p> <p>first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then</p> <p>she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that</p> <p>it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this</p> <p>mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should</p> <p>think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in</p> <p>trying.' So she began: `O Mouse, do you know the way out of</p> <p>this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'</p> <p>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:</p> <p>she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having</p> <p>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a</p> <p>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather</p> <p>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little</p> <p>eyes, but it said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I</p> <p>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the</p> <p>Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had</p> <p>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she</p> <p>began again: `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in</p> <p>her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the</p> <p>water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg</p> <p>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the</p> <p>poor animal's feelings. `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate</p> <p>voice. `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: `don't be</p> <p>angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:</p> <p>I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</p> <p>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,</p> <p>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so</p> <p>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and</p> <p>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital</p> <p>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,</p> <p>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt</p> <p>certain it must be really offended. `We won't talk about her any</p> <p>more if you'd rather not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end</p> <p>of his tail. `As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family</p> <p>always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear</p> <p>the name again!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the</p> <p>subject of conversation. `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'</p> <p>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: `There is</p> <p>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</p> <p>A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly</p> <p>brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and</p> <p>it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I</p> <p>can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you</p> <p>know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!</p> <p>He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the</p> <p>Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and</p> <p>making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p> <p></p> <p> So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear! Do come back</p> <p>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't</p> <p>like them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam</p> <p>slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice</p> <p>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to</p> <p>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll</p> <p>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded</p> <p>with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a</p> <p>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious</p> <p>creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the</p> <p>shore.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER III</p> <p></p> <p> A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the</p> <p>bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their</p> <p>fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and</p> <p>uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they</p> <p>had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed</p> <p>quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with</p> <p>them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had</p> <p>quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,</p> <p>and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';</p> <p>and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,</p> <p>and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no</p> <p>more to be said.</p> <p></p> <p> At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among</p> <p>them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL</p> <p>soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large</p> <p>ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes</p> <p>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad</p> <p>cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?</p> <p>This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!</p> <p>"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was</p> <p>soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been</p> <p>of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very</p> <p>politely: `Did you speak?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought you did,' said the Mouse. `--I proceed. "Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:</p> <p>and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found</p> <p>it advisable--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.</p> <p></p> <p> `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: `of course you</p> <p>know what "it" means.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said</p> <p>the Duck: `it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is,</p> <p>what did the archbishop find?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,</p> <p>`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William</p> <p>and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was</p> <p>moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you</p> <p>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it</p> <p>spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: `it doesn't</p> <p>seem to dry me at all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I</p> <p>move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more</p> <p>energetic remedies--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak English!' said the Eaglet. `I don't know the meaning of</p> <p>half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do</p> <p>either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:</p> <p>some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p> <p></p> <p> `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,</p> <p>`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much</p> <p>to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY</p> <p>ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'</p> <p>(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter</p> <p>day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p> <p></p> <p> First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the</p> <p>exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party</p> <p>were placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One,</p> <p>two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,</p> <p>and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know</p> <p>when the race was over. However, when they had been running half</p> <p>an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called</p> <p>out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,</p> <p>and asking, `But who has won?'</p> <p></p> <p> This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of</p> <p>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon</p> <p>its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,</p> <p>in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At</p> <p>last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have</p> <p>prizes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices</p> <p>asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with</p> <p>one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,</p> <p>calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand</p> <p>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt</p> <p>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</p> <p>There was exactly one a-piece all round.</p> <p></p> <p> `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have</p> <p>you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.</p> <p></p> <p> Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo</p> <p>solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of</p> <p>this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short</p> <p>speech, they all cheered.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked</p> <p>so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not</p> <p>think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,</p> <p>looking as solemn as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise</p> <p>and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not</p> <p>taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on</p> <p>the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again</p> <p>in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p> <p></p> <p> `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,</p> <p>`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half</p> <p>afraid that it would be offended again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to</p> <p>Alice, and sighing.</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with</p> <p>wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And</p> <p>she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so</p> <p>that her idea of the tale was something like this:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Fury said to a</p> <p> mouse, That he</p> <p> met in the</p> <p> house,</p> <p> "Let us</p> <p> both go to</p> <p> law: I will</p> <p> prosecute</p> <p> YOU. --Come,</p> <p> I'll take no</p> <p> denial; We</p> <p> must have a</p> <p> trial: For</p> <p> really this</p> <p> morning I've</p> <p> nothing</p> <p> to do."</p> <p> Said the</p> <p> mouse to the</p> <p> cur, "Such</p> <p> a trial,</p> <p> dear Sir,</p> <p> With</p> <p> no jury</p> <p> or judge,</p> <p> would be</p> <p> wasting</p> <p> our</p> <p> breath."</p> <p> "I'll be</p> <p> judge, I'll</p> <p> be jury,"</p> <p> Said</p> <p> cunning</p> <p> old Fury:</p> <p> "I'll</p> <p> try the</p> <p> whole</p> <p> cause,</p> <p> and</p> <p> condemn</p> <p> you</p> <p> to</p> <p> death."'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.</p> <p>`What are you thinking of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to</p> <p>the fifth bend, I think?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up</p> <p>and walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily</p> <p>offended, you know!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse only growled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after</p> <p>it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but</p> <p>the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little</p> <p>quicker.</p> <p></p> <p> `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it</p> <p>was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of</p> <p>saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you</p> <p>never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the</p> <p>young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the</p> <p>patience of an oyster!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,</p> <p>addressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'</p> <p>said the Lory.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about</p> <p>her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for</p> <p>catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her</p> <p>after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look</p> <p>at it!'</p> <p></p> <p> This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</p> <p>Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began</p> <p>wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be</p> <p>getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary</p> <p>called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my</p> <p>dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts</p> <p>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a</p> <p>melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm</p> <p>sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I</p> <p>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice</p> <p>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</p> <p>In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of</p> <p>footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping</p> <p>that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to</p> <p>finish his story.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IV</p> <p></p> <p> The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;</p> <p>and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!</p> <p>Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me</p> <p>executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have</p> <p>dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was</p> <p>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she</p> <p>very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were</p> <p>nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her</p> <p>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and</p> <p>the little door, had vanished completely.</p> <p></p> <p> Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,</p> <p>and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE</p> <p>you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of</p> <p>gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened</p> <p>that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without</p> <p>trying to explain the mistake it had made.</p> <p></p> <p> `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.</p> <p>`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd</p> <p>better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'</p> <p>As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door</p> <p>of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'</p> <p>engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried</p> <p>upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,</p> <p>and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and</p> <p>gloves.</p> <p></p> <p> `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going</p> <p>messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on</p> <p>messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that</p> <p>would happen: `"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready</p> <p>for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see</p> <p>that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went</p> <p>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering</p> <p>people about like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with</p> <p>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two</p> <p>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and</p> <p>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when</p> <p>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-</p> <p>glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'</p> <p>but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know</p> <p>SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,</p> <p>`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this</p> <p>bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for</p> <p>really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'</p> <p></p> <p> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:</p> <p>before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing</p> <p>against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being</p> <p>broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself</p> <p>`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I</p> <p>can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so</p> <p>much!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and</p> <p>growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in</p> <p>another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried</p> <p>the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the</p> <p>other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,</p> <p>as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one</p> <p>foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,</p> <p>whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'</p> <p></p> <p> Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full</p> <p>effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,</p> <p>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting</p> <p>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one</p> <p>wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about</p> <p>by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that</p> <p>rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,</p> <p>this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!</p> <p>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing</p> <p>never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There</p> <p>ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when</p> <p>I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more</p> <p>HERE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I</p> <p>am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--</p> <p>but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you</p> <p>learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no</p> <p>room at all for any lesson-books!'</p> <p></p> <p> And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,</p> <p>and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few</p> <p>minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves</p> <p>this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the</p> <p>stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and</p> <p>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she</p> <p>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no</p> <p>reason to be afraid of it.</p> <p></p> <p> Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;</p> <p>but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed</p> <p>hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it</p> <p>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she</p> <p>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly</p> <p>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not</p> <p>get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,</p> <p>and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was</p> <p>just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something</p> <p>of the sort.</p> <p></p> <p> Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are</p> <p>you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then</p> <p>I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!</p> <p>Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')</p> <p></p> <p> `An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it</p> <p>fills the whole window!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it</p> <p>away!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear</p> <p>whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer</p> <p>honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at</p> <p>last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in</p> <p>the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more</p> <p>sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there</p> <p>must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for</p> <p>pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I</p> <p>don't want to stay in here any longer!'</p> <p></p> <p> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at</p> <p>last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a</p> <p>good many voices all talking together: she made out the words:</p> <p>`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;</p> <p>Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up</p> <p>at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half</p> <p>high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--</p> <p>Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind</p> <p>that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud</p> <p>crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go</p> <p>down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,</p> <p>then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to</p> <p>go down the chimney!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said</p> <p>Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!</p> <p>I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is</p> <p>narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'</p> <p></p> <p> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and</p> <p>waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what</p> <p>sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close</p> <p>above her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one</p> <p>sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes</p> <p>Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the</p> <p>hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold</p> <p>up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?</p> <p>What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'</p> <p></p> <p> Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'</p> <p>thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm</p> <p>better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know</p> <p>is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes</p> <p>like a sky-rocket!'</p> <p></p> <p> `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and</p> <p>Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do. I'll set</p> <p>Dinah at you!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to</p> <p>herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any</p> <p>sense, they'd take the roof off.' After a minute or two, they</p> <p>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A</p> <p>barrowful will do, to begin with.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to</p> <p>doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came</p> <p>rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.</p> <p>`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,</p> <p>`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead</p> <p>silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all</p> <p>turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright</p> <p>idea came into her head. `If I eat one of these cakes,' she</p> <p>thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it</p> <p>can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I</p> <p>suppose.'</p> <p></p> <p> So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find</p> <p>that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small</p> <p>enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and</p> <p>found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.</p> <p>The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by</p> <p>two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.</p> <p>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she</p> <p>ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a</p> <p>thick wood.</p> <p></p> <p> `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she</p> <p>wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;</p> <p>and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</p> <p>I think that will be the best plan.'</p> <p></p> <p> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and</p> <p>simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the</p> <p>smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering</p> <p>about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over</p> <p>her head made her look up in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round</p> <p>eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</p> <p>`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried</p> <p>hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the</p> <p>time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it</p> <p>would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</p> <p></p> <p> Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of</p> <p>stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped</p> <p>into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,</p> <p>and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice</p> <p>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run</p> <p>over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy</p> <p>made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in</p> <p>its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very</p> <p>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every</p> <p>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle</p> <p>again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the</p> <p>stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long</p> <p>way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat</p> <p>down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its</p> <p>mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p> <p></p> <p> This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;</p> <p>so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out</p> <p>of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the</p> <p>distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she</p> <p>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself</p> <p>with one of the leaves: `I should have liked teaching it tricks</p> <p>very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh</p> <p>dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let</p> <p>me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or</p> <p>drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'</p> <p></p> <p> The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round</p> <p>her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see</p> <p>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under</p> <p>the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,</p> <p>about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under</p> <p>it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her</p> <p>that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.</p> <p></p> <p> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of</p> <p>the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large</p> <p>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,</p> <p>quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice</p> <p>of her or of anything else.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER V</p> <p></p> <p> Advice from a Caterpillar</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in</p> <p>silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice</p> <p>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--</p> <p>at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think</p> <p>I must have been changed several times since then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</p> <p>`Explain yourself!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because</p> <p>I'm not myself, you see.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very</p> <p>politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and</p> <p>being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but</p> <p>when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you</p> <p>know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll</p> <p>feel it a little queer, won't you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;</p> <p>`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. `Who are YOU?'</p> <p></p> <p> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the</p> <p>conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's</p> <p>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,</p> <p>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not</p> <p>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in</p> <p>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. `I've something</p> <p>important to say!'</p> <p></p> <p> This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as</p> <p>she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else</p> <p>to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth</p> <p>hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but</p> <p>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth</p> <p>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as</p> <p>I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it</p> <p>all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice folded her hands, and began:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,</p> <p> `And your hair has become very white;</p> <p> And yet you incessantly stand on your head--</p> <p> Do you think, at your age, it is right?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,</p> <p> `I feared it might injure the brain;</p> <p> But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,</p> <p> Why, I do it again and again.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,</p> <p> And have grown most uncommonly fat;</p> <p> Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--</p> <p> Pray, what is the reason of that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</p> <p> `I kept all my limbs very supple</p> <p> By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--</p> <p> Allow me to sell you a couple?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak</p> <p> For anything tougher than suet;</p> <p> Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--</p> <p> Pray how did you manage to do it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,</p> <p> And argued each case with my wife;</p> <p> And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,</p> <p> Has lasted the rest of my life.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose</p> <p> That your eye was as steady as ever;</p> <p> Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--</p> <p> What made you so awfully clever?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'</p> <p> Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!</p> <p> Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?</p> <p> Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the</p> <p>words have got altered.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.</p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar was the first to speak.</p> <p></p> <p> `What size do you want to be?' it asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;</p> <p>`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in</p> <p>her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you</p> <p>wouldn't mind,' said Alice: `three inches is such a wretched</p> <p>height to be.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three</p> <p>inches high).</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</p> <p>And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so</p> <p>easily offended!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it</p> <p>put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</p> <p></p> <p> This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</p> <p>In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got</p> <p>down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely</p> <p>remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and</p> <p>the other side will make you grow shorter.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had</p> <p>asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a</p> <p>minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as</p> <p>it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</p> <p>However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they</p> <p>would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p> <p></p> <p> `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a</p> <p>little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment</p> <p>she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her</p> <p>foot!</p> <p></p> <p> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but</p> <p>she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking</p> <p>rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.</p> <p>Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was</p> <p>hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and</p> <p>managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of</p> <p>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she</p> <p>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could</p> <p>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which</p> <p>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay</p> <p>far below her.</p> <p></p> <p> `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. `And where</p> <p>HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I</p> <p>can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no</p> <p>result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the</p> <p>distant green leaves.</p> <p></p> <p> As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her</p> <p>head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted</p> <p>to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,</p> <p>like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a</p> <p>graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which</p> <p>she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she</p> <p>had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a</p> <p>hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating</p> <p>her violently with its wings.</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. `Let me alone!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more</p> <p>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every</p> <p>way, and nothing seems to suit them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've</p> <p>tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but</p> <p>those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no</p> <p>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</p> <p></p> <p> `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the</p> <p>Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and</p> <p>day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was</p> <p>beginning to see its meaning.</p> <p></p> <p> `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued</p> <p>the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was</p> <p>thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come</p> <p>wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. `I'm a--I'm</p> <p>a--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're</p> <p>trying to invent something!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she</p> <p>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the</p> <p>deepest contempt. `I've seen a good many little girls in my</p> <p>time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a</p> <p>serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be</p> <p>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very</p> <p>truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as</p> <p>serpents do, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why</p> <p>then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent</p> <p>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of</p> <p>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and</p> <p>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a</p> <p>serpent?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm</p> <p>not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't</p> <p>want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it</p> <p>settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the</p> <p>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled</p> <p>among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and</p> <p>untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the</p> <p>pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very</p> <p>carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and</p> <p>growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had</p> <p>succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p> <p></p> <p> It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,</p> <p>that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a</p> <p>few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come,</p> <p>there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes</p> <p>are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to</p> <p>another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next</p> <p>thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be</p> <p>done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an</p> <p>open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</p> <p>`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come</p> <p>upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their</p> <p>wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did</p> <p>not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself</p> <p>down to nine inches high.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VI</p> <p></p> <p> Pig and Pepper</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and</p> <p>wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came</p> <p>running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman</p> <p>because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only,</p> <p>she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door</p> <p>with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,</p> <p>with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,</p> <p>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their</p> <p>heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and</p> <p>crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great</p> <p>letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to</p> <p>the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess. An</p> <p>invitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman</p> <p>repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the</p> <p>words a little, `From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess</p> <p>to play croquet.'</p> <p></p> <p> Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled</p> <p>together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into</p> <p>the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped</p> <p>out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the</p> <p>ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and</p> <p>that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the</p> <p>door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise</p> <p>inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was</p> <p>a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling</p> <p>and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish</p> <p>or kettle had been broken to pieces.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'</p> <p></p> <p> `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went</p> <p>on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us. For</p> <p>instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let</p> <p>you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time</p> <p>he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. `But</p> <p>perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so</p> <p>VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might</p> <p>answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate</p> <p>came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just</p> <p>grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees</p> <p>behind him.</p> <p></p> <p> `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,</p> <p>exactly as if nothing had happened.</p> <p></p> <p> `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. `That's the</p> <p>first question, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.</p> <p>`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the</p> <p>creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for</p> <p>repeating his remark, with variations. `I shall sit here,' he</p> <p>said, `on and off, for days and days.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what am I to do?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:</p> <p>`he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.</p> <p></p> <p> The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of</p> <p>smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a</p> <p>three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was</p> <p>leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to</p> <p>be full of soup.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to</p> <p>herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p> <p></p> <p> There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the</p> <p>Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was</p> <p>sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The</p> <p>only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,</p> <p>and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from</p> <p>ear to ear.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for</p> <p>she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to</p> <p>speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!'</p> <p></p> <p> She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice</p> <p>quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed</p> <p>to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I</p> <p>didn't know that cats COULD grin.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,</p> <p>feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</p> <p></p> <p> `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought</p> <p>it would be as well to introduce some other subject of</p> <p>conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took</p> <p>the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work</p> <p>throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby</p> <p>--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,</p> <p>plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when</p> <p>they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it</p> <p>was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up</p> <p>and down in an agony of terror. `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS</p> <p>nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very</p> <p>nearly carried it off.</p> <p></p> <p> `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a</p> <p>hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it</p> <p>does.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very</p> <p>glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her</p> <p>knowledge. `Just think of what work it would make with the day</p> <p>and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn</p> <p>round on its axis--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant</p> <p>to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and</p> <p>seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: `Twenty-four</p> <p>hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide</p> <p>figures!' And with that she began nursing her child again,</p> <p>singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a</p> <p>violent shake at the end of every line:</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak roughly to your little boy,</p> <p> And beat him when he sneezes:</p> <p> He only does it to annoy,</p> <p> Because he knows it teases.'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> (In which the cook and the baby joined):--</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept</p> <p>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing</p> <p>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I speak severely to my boy,</p> <p> I beat him when he sneezes;</p> <p> For he can thoroughly enjoy</p> <p> The pepper when he pleases!'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said</p> <p>to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. `I must go and</p> <p>get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of</p> <p>the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,</p> <p>but it just missed her.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-</p> <p>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all</p> <p>directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor</p> <p>little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,</p> <p>and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,</p> <p>so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much</p> <p>as she could do to hold it.</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,</p> <p>(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep</p> <p>tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its</p> <p>undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. `IF I</p> <p>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure</p> <p>to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it</p> <p>behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing</p> <p>grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). `Don't</p> <p>grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing</p> <p>yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into</p> <p>its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no</p> <p>doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout</p> <p>than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for</p> <p>a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at</p> <p>all. `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked</p> <p>into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</p> <p></p> <p> No, there were no tears. `If you're going to turn into a pig,</p> <p>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do</p> <p>with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or</p> <p>grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for</p> <p>some while in silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I</p> <p>to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted</p> <p>again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some</p> <p>alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was</p> <p>neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be</p> <p>quite absurd for her to carry it further.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to</p> <p>see it trot away quietly into the wood. `If it had grown up,'</p> <p>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:</p> <p>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began</p> <p>thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as</p> <p>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right</p> <p>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing</p> <p>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-</p> <p>natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great</p> <p>many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p> <p></p> <p> `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at</p> <p>all know whether it would like the name: however, it only</p> <p>grinned a little wider. `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought</p> <p>Alice, and she went on. `Would you tell me, please, which way I</p> <p>ought to go from here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said</p> <p>the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't much care where--' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk</p> <p>long enough.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another</p> <p>question. `What sort of people live about here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,</p> <p>`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,</p> <p>`lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.</p> <p>I'm mad. You're mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on</p> <p>`And how do you know that you're mad?'</p> <p></p> <p> `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad. You grant</p> <p>that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I suppose so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's</p> <p>angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm</p> <p>pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call it what you like,' said the Cat. `Do you play croquet</p> <p>with the Queen to-day?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been</p> <p>invited yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used</p> <p>to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place</p> <p>where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.</p> <p></p> <p> `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. `I'd</p> <p>nearly forgotten to ask.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had</p> <p>come back in a natural way.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it</p> <p>did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the</p> <p>direction in which the March Hare was said to live. `I've seen</p> <p>hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be</p> <p>much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be</p> <p>raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.' As she said</p> <p>this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a</p> <p>branch of a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep</p> <p>appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'</p> <p></p> <p> `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,</p> <p>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,</p> <p>which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever</p> <p>saw in my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the</p> <p>house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house,</p> <p>because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was</p> <p>thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not</p> <p>like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand</p> <p>bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even</p> <p>then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself</p> <p>`Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd</p> <p>gone to see the Hatter instead!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VII</p> <p></p> <p> A Mad Tea-Party</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,</p> <p>and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a</p> <p>Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two</p> <p>were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking</p> <p>over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p> <p></p> <p> The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded</p> <p>together at one corner of it: `No room! No room!' they cried</p> <p>out when they saw Alice coming. `There's PLENTY of room!' said</p> <p>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one</p> <p>end of the table.</p> <p></p> <p> `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it</p> <p>but tea. `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice</p> <p>angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being</p> <p>invited,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a</p> <p>great many more than three.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been</p> <p>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was</p> <p>his first speech.</p> <p></p> <p> `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said</p> <p>with some severity; `it's very rude.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all</p> <p>he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. `I'm glad</p> <p>they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she</p> <p>added aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'</p> <p>said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what</p> <p>I say--that's the same thing, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. `You might just</p> <p>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat</p> <p>what I see"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I</p> <p>like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to</p> <p>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the</p> <p>same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the</p> <p>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,</p> <p>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and</p> <p>writing-desks, which wasn't much.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter was the first to break the silence. `What day of</p> <p>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his</p> <p>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking</p> <p>it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. `I told you butter</p> <p>wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March</p> <p>Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter</p> <p>grumbled: `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'</p> <p></p> <p> The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then</p> <p>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he</p> <p>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It</p> <p>was the BEST butter, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</p> <p>`What a funny watch!' she remarked. `It tells the day of the</p> <p>month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. `Does YOUR watch tell</p> <p>you what year it is?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: `but that's</p> <p>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to</p> <p>have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</p> <p>`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she</p> <p>could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured</p> <p>a little hot tea upon its nose.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without</p> <p>opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to</p> <p>remark myself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to</p> <p>Alice again.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I give it up,' Alice replied: `what's the answer?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nor I,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice sighed wearily. `I think you might do something better</p> <p>with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that</p> <p>have no answers.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you</p> <p>wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head</p> <p>contemptuously. `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: `but I know I have to</p> <p>beat time when I learn music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. `He won't stand</p> <p>beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do</p> <p>almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose</p> <p>it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:</p> <p>you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the</p> <p>clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'</p> <p></p> <p> (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a</p> <p>whisper.)</p> <p></p> <p> `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:</p> <p>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: `but you could keep</p> <p>it to half-past one as long as you liked.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter shook his head mournfully. `Not I!' he replied.</p> <p>`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'</p> <p>(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the</p> <p>great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing</p> <p></p> <p> "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</p> <p> How I wonder what you're at!"</p> <p></p> <p>You know the song, perhaps?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--</p> <p></p> <p> "Up above the world you fly,</p> <p> Like a tea-tray in the sky.</p> <p> Twinkle, twinkle--"'</p> <p></p> <p>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep</p> <p>`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that</p> <p>they had to pinch it to make it stop.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,</p> <p>`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the</p> <p>time! Off with his head!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,</p> <p>`he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'</p> <p></p> <p> A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so</p> <p>many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always</p> <p>tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice</p> <p>ventured to ask.</p> <p></p> <p> `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,</p> <p>yawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady</p> <p>tells us a story.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at</p> <p>the proposal.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. `Wake up,</p> <p>Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. `I wasn't asleep,' he</p> <p>said in a hoarse, feeble voice: `I heard every word you fellows</p> <p>were saying.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep</p> <p>again before it's done.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the</p> <p>Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,</p> <p>Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great</p> <p>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</p> <p></p> <p> `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a</p> <p>minute or two.</p> <p></p> <p> `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently</p> <p>remarked; `they'd have been ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways</p> <p>of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went</p> <p>on: `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very</p> <p>earnestly.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so</p> <p>I can't take more.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very</p> <p>easy to take MORE than nothing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked</p> <p>triumphantly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped</p> <p>herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the</p> <p>Dormouse, and repeated her question. `Why did they live at the</p> <p>bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and</p> <p>then said, `It was a treacle-well.'</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but</p> <p>the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse</p> <p>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the</p> <p>story for yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt</p> <p>again. I dare say there may be ONE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he</p> <p>consented to go on. `And so these three little sisters--they</p> <p>were learning to draw, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this</p> <p>time.</p> <p></p> <p> `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: `let's all move</p> <p>one place on.'</p> <p></p> <p> He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the</p> <p>March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather</p> <p>unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the</p> <p>only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a</p> <p>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset</p> <p>the milk-jug into his plate.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began</p> <p>very cautiously: `But I don't understand. Where did they draw</p> <p>the treacle from?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so</p> <p>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,</p> <p>stupid?'</p> <p></p> <p> `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not</p> <p>choosing to notice this last remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'</p> <p></p> <p> This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse</p> <p>go on for some time without interrupting it.</p> <p></p> <p> `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and</p> <p>rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew</p> <p>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why with an M?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why not?' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going</p> <p>off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up</p> <p>again with a little shriek, and went on: `--that begins with an</p> <p>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--</p> <p>you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever</p> <p>see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I</p> <p>don't think--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got</p> <p>up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep</p> <p>instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her</p> <p>going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that</p> <p>they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were</p> <p>trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</p> <p></p> <p> `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she</p> <p>picked her way through the wood. `It's the stupidest tea-party I</p> <p>ever was at in all my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a</p> <p>door leading right into it. `That's very curious!' she thought.</p> <p>`But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.'</p> <p>And in she went.</p> <p></p> <p> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the</p> <p>little glass table. `Now, I'll manage better this time,'</p> <p>she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,</p> <p>and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went</p> <p>to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it</p> <p>in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down</p> <p>the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the</p> <p>beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VIII</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's Croquet-Ground</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the</p> <p>roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at</p> <p>it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious</p> <p>thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up</p> <p>to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go</p> <p>splashing paint over me like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged</p> <p>my elbow.'</p> <p></p> <p> On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always</p> <p>lay the blame on others!'</p> <p></p> <p> `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. `I heard the Queen say only</p> <p>yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it</p> <p>was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'</p> <p></p> <p> Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all</p> <p>the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as</p> <p>she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the</p> <p>others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are</p> <p>painting those roses?'</p> <p></p> <p> Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a</p> <p>low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to</p> <p>have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;</p> <p>and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads</p> <p>cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore</p> <p>she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously</p> <p>looking across the garden, called out `The Queen! The Queen!'</p> <p>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon</p> <p>their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice</p> <p>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped</p> <p>like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and</p> <p>feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were</p> <p>ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the</p> <p>soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were</p> <p>ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand</p> <p>in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next</p> <p>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice</p> <p>recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous</p> <p>manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without</p> <p>noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the</p> <p>King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this</p> <p>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on</p> <p>her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember</p> <p>ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,</p> <p>what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people</p> <p>had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'</p> <p>So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p> <p></p> <p> When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped</p> <p>and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'</p> <p>She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,</p> <p>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'</p> <p></p> <p> `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very</p> <p>politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of</p> <p>cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three</p> <p>gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as</p> <p>they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs</p> <p>was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether</p> <p>they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her</p> <p>own children.</p> <p></p> <p> `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</p> <p>`It's no business of MINE.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her</p> <p>for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!</p> <p>Off--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the</p> <p>Queen was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said</p> <p>`Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave</p> <p>`Turn them over!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p> <p></p> <p> `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the</p> <p>three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the</p> <p>King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</p> <p></p> <p> `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. `You make me giddy.'</p> <p>And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you</p> <p>been doing here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,</p> <p>going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the</p> <p>roses. `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,</p> <p>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate</p> <p>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</p> <p></p> <p> `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a</p> <p>large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered</p> <p>about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly</p> <p>marched off after the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers</p> <p>shouted in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's right!' shouted the Queen. `Can you play croquet?'</p> <p></p> <p> The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question</p> <p>was evidently meant for her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes!' shouted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the</p> <p>procession, wondering very much what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.</p> <p>She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously</p> <p>into her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very,' said Alice: `--where's the Duchess?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He</p> <p>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised</p> <p>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and</p> <p>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I didn't,' said Alice: `I don't think it's at all a pity.</p> <p>I said "What for?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a</p> <p>little scream of laughter. `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a</p> <p>frightened tone. `The Queen will hear you! You see, she came</p> <p>rather late, and the Queen said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,</p> <p>and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up</p> <p>against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or</p> <p>two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a</p> <p>curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and</p> <p>furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live</p> <p>flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to</p> <p>stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p> <p></p> <p> The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her</p> <p>flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,</p> <p>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,</p> <p>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened</p> <p>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it</p> <p>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a</p> <p>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:</p> <p>and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,</p> <p>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled</p> <p>itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,</p> <p>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she</p> <p>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers</p> <p>were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the</p> <p>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very</p> <p>difficult game indeed.</p> <p></p> <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns,</p> <p>quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in</p> <p>a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went</p> <p>stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with</p> <p>her head!' about once in a minute.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as</p> <p>yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might</p> <p>happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of</p> <p>me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great</p> <p>wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'</p> <p></p> <p> She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering</p> <p>whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a</p> <p>curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at</p> <p>first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to</p> <p>be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat: now I</p> <p>shall have somebody to talk to.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was</p> <p>mouth enough for it to speak with.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. `It's no</p> <p>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at</p> <p>least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared,</p> <p>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the</p> <p>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The</p> <p>Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and</p> <p>no more of it appeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather</p> <p>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't</p> <p>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in</p> <p>particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and</p> <p>you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;</p> <p>for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next</p> <p>walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have</p> <p>croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it</p> <p>saw mine coming!'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at all,' said Alice: `she's so extremely--' Just then</p> <p>she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so</p> <p>she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while</p> <p>finishing the game.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen smiled and passed on.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and</p> <p>looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: `allow me</p> <p>to introduce it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:</p> <p>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me</p> <p>like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. `I've read that in</p> <p>some book, but I don't remember where.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and</p> <p>he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear! I</p> <p>wish you would have this cat removed!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great</p> <p>or small. `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking</p> <p>round.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and</p> <p>he hurried off.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game</p> <p>was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,</p> <p>screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three</p> <p>of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and</p> <p>she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in</p> <p>such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or</p> <p>not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p> <p></p> <p> The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,</p> <p>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one</p> <p>of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her</p> <p>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where</p> <p>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up</p> <p>into a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,</p> <p>the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:</p> <p>`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches</p> <p>are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away</p> <p>under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for</p> <p>a little more conversation with her friend.</p> <p></p> <p> When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to</p> <p>find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute</p> <p>going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who</p> <p>were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,</p> <p>and looked very uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to</p> <p>settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,</p> <p>though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed</p> <p>to make out exactly what they said.</p> <p></p> <p> The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a</p> <p>head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had</p> <p>never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin</p> <p>at HIS time of life.</p> <p></p> <p> The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be</p> <p>beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about</p> <p>it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.</p> <p>(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so</p> <p>grave and anxious.)</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the</p> <p>Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: `fetch</p> <p>her here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,</p> <p>by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely</p> <p>disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down</p> <p>looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IX</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle's Story</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old</p> <p>thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately</p> <p>into Alice's, and they walked off together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and</p> <p>thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had</p> <p>made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p> `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very</p> <p>hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT</p> <p>ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that</p> <p>makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at</p> <p>having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them</p> <p>sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar</p> <p>and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish</p> <p>people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you</p> <p>know--'</p> <p></p> <p> She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a</p> <p>little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</p> <p>`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you</p> <p>forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that</p> <p>is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. `Everything's got a</p> <p>moral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up</p> <p>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first,</p> <p>because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was</p> <p>exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,</p> <p>and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not</p> <p>like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of</p> <p>keeping up the conversation a little.</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis so,' said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--"Oh,</p> <p>'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody</p> <p>minding their own business!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,</p> <p>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,</p> <p>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the</p> <p>sounds will take care of themselves."'</p> <p></p> <p> `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your</p> <p>waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I'm</p> <p>doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the</p> <p>experiment?'</p> <p></p> <p> `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all</p> <p>anxious to have the experiment tried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very true,' said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both</p> <p>bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock</p> <p>together."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: `what a clear way you</p> <p>have of putting things!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree</p> <p>to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near</p> <p>here. And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the</p> <p>less there is of yours."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this</p> <p>last remark, `it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it</p> <p>is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of</p> <p>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put</p> <p>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than</p> <p>what it might appear to others that what you were or might have</p> <p>been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared</p> <p>to them to be otherwise."'</p> <p></p> <p> `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very</p> <p>politely, `if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it</p> <p>as you say it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess</p> <p>replied, in a pleased tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'</p> <p>said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. `I make you</p> <p>a present of everything I've said as yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. `I'm glad they don't</p> <p>give birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to</p> <p>say it out loud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her</p> <p>sharp little chin.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was</p> <p>beginning to feel a little worried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;</p> <p>and the m--'</p> <p></p> <p> But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died</p> <p>away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the</p> <p>arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up,</p> <p>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,</p> <p>frowning like a thunderstorm.</p> <p></p> <p> `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on</p> <p>the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,</p> <p>and that in about half no time! Take your choice!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p> <p></p> <p> `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice</p> <p>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her</p> <p>back to the croquet-ground.</p> <p></p> <p> The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,</p> <p>and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her,</p> <p>they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a</p> <p>moment's delay would cost them their lives.</p> <p></p> <p> All the time they were playing the Queen never left off</p> <p>quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his</p> <p>head!' or `Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were</p> <p>taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave</p> <p>off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour</p> <p>or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the</p> <p>King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of</p> <p>execution.</p> <p></p> <p> Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to</p> <p>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said Alice. `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his</p> <p>history,'</p> <p></p> <p> As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low</p> <p>voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.' `Come,</p> <p>THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite</p> <p>unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p> <p></p> <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the</p> <p>sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)</p> <p>`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to</p> <p>see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and</p> <p>see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,</p> <p>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like</p> <p>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would</p> <p>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage</p> <p>Queen: so she waited.</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the</p> <p>Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!'</p> <p>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the fun?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. `It's all her fancy, that: they</p> <p>never executes nobody, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went</p> <p>slowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life,</p> <p>never!'</p> <p></p> <p> They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the</p> <p>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,</p> <p>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart</p> <p>would break. She pitied him deeply. `What is his sorrow?' she</p> <p>asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the</p> <p>same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got</p> <p>no sorrow, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with</p> <p>large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to</p> <p>know your history, she do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow</p> <p>tone: `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've</p> <p>finished.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice</p> <p>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he</p> <p>doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.</p> <p></p> <p> `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was</p> <p>a real Turtle.'</p> <p></p> <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only</p> <p>by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and</p> <p>the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very</p> <p>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your</p> <p>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be</p> <p>more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more</p> <p>calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to</p> <p>school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call</p> <p>him Tortoise--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle angrily: `really you are very dull!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple</p> <p>question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and</p> <p>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At</p> <p>last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!</p> <p>Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe</p> <p>it--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak</p> <p>again. The Mock Turtle went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school</p> <p>every day--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be</p> <p>so proud as all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle in a tone of great relief. `Now at OURS they had at the</p> <p>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'</p> <p></p> <p> `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the</p> <p>bottom of the sea.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a</p> <p>sigh. `I only took the regular course.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was that?' inquired Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock</p> <p>Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--</p> <p>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. `What is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. `What! Never</p> <p>heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. `You know what to beautify is,</p> <p>I suppose?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to</p> <p>uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about</p> <p>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you</p> <p>to learn?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting</p> <p>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,</p> <p>with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old</p> <p>conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us</p> <p>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was THAT like?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: `I'm</p> <p>too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics</p> <p>master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he</p> <p>taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;</p> <p>and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a</p> <p>hurry to change the subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the</p> <p>next, and so on.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon</p> <p>remarked: `because they lessen from day to day.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a</p> <p>little before she made her next remark. `Then the eleventh day</p> <p>must have been a holiday?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a</p> <p>very decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER X</p> <p></p> <p> The Lobster Quadrille</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper</p> <p>across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for</p> <p>a minute or two sobs choked his voice. `Same as if he had a bone</p> <p>in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him</p> <p>and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered</p> <p>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--</p> <p>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'</p> <p>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,</p> <p>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful</p> <p>thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, indeed,' said Alice. `What sort of a dance is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;</p> <p>then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `--you advance twice--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: `advance twice, set to</p> <p>partners--'</p> <p></p> <p> `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the</p> <p>Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</p> <p></p> <p> `--as far out to sea as you can--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,</p> <p>capering wildly about.</p> <p></p> <p> `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the</p> <p>Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,</p> <p>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat</p> <p>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very much indeed,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the</p> <p>Gryphon. `We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall</p> <p>sing?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. `I've forgotten the words.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now</p> <p>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and</p> <p>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle</p> <p>sang this, very slowly and sadly:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>`"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.</p> <p>"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my</p> <p> tail.</p> <p>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</p> <p>They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be</p> <p>When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to</p> <p> sea!"</p> <p>But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look</p> <p> askance--</p> <p>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the</p> <p> dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p></p> <p>`"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.</p> <p>"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.</p> <p>The further off from England the nearer is to France--</p> <p>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</p> <p></p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p> dance?</p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p> dance?"'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said</p> <p>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: `and I do so</p> <p>like that curious song about the whiting!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've</p> <p>seen them, of course?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she</p> <p>checked herself hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but</p> <p>if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're</p> <p>like.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. `They have their</p> <p>tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:</p> <p>`crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails</p> <p>in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle</p> <p>yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all</p> <p>that,' he said to the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with</p> <p>the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So</p> <p>they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in</p> <p>their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting. I never knew</p> <p>so much about a whiting before.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the</p> <p>Gryphon. `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never thought about it,' said Alice. `Why?'</p> <p></p> <p> `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very</p> <p>solemnly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was thoroughly puzzled. `Does the boots and shoes!' she</p> <p>repeated in a wondering tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. `I</p> <p>mean, what makes them so shiny?'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she</p> <p>gave her answer. `They're done with blacking, I believe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep</p> <p>voice, `are done with a whiting. Now you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great</p> <p>curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather</p> <p>impatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were</p> <p>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep</p> <p>back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>said: `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came</p> <p>to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With</p> <p>what porpoise?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended</p> <p>tone. And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR</p> <p>adventures.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'</p> <p>said Alice a little timidly: `but it's no use going back to</p> <p>yesterday, because I was a different person then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an</p> <p>impatient tone: `explanations take such a dreadful time.'</p> <p></p> <p> So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when</p> <p>she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about</p> <p>it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on</p> <p>each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she</p> <p>gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly</p> <p>quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,</p> <p>FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming</p> <p>different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said</p> <p>`That's very curious.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated</p> <p>thoughtfully. `I should like to hear her try and repeat</p> <p>something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as</p> <p>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said</p> <p>the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat</p> <p>lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'</p> <p>However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so</p> <p>full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was</p> <p>saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,</p> <p> "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."</p> <p> As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose</p> <p> Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,</p> <p> And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,</p> <p> But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,</p> <p> His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]</p> <p></p> <p> `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'</p> <p>said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it</p> <p>sounds uncommon nonsense.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her</p> <p>hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. `Go on with</p> <p>the next verse.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. `How COULD</p> <p>he turn them out with his nose, you know?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was</p> <p>dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the</p> <p>subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:</p> <p>`it begins "I passed by his garden."'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would</p> <p>all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,</p> <p> How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,</p> <p> While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</p> <p> When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,</p> <p> Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:</p> <p> While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,</p> <p> And concluded the banquet--]</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far</p> <p>the most confusing thing I ever heard!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and</p> <p>Alice was only too glad to do so.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the</p> <p>Gryphon went on. `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you</p> <p>a song?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'</p> <p>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather</p> <p>offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her</p> <p>"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes</p> <p>choked with sobs, to sing this:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</p> <p> Waiting in a hot tureen!</p> <p> Who for such dainties would not stoop?</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,</p> <p> Game, or any other dish?</p> <p> Who would not give all else for two</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had</p> <p>just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'</p> <p>was heard in the distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,</p> <p>it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</p> <p></p> <p> `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon</p> <p>only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more</p> <p>faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the</p> <p>melancholy words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XI</p> <p></p> <p> Who Stole the Tarts?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when</p> <p>they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts</p> <p>of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:</p> <p>the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on</p> <p>each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,</p> <p>with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the</p> <p>other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large</p> <p>dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice</p> <p>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'</p> <p>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed</p> <p>to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about</p> <p>her, to pass away the time.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had</p> <p>read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that</p> <p>she knew the name of nearly everything there. `That's the</p> <p>judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'</p> <p></p> <p> The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown</p> <p>over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he</p> <p>did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly</p> <p>not becoming.</p> <p></p> <p> `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve</p> <p>creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because</p> <p>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they</p> <p>are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over</p> <p>to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and</p> <p>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the</p> <p>meaning of it at all. However, `jury-men' would have done just</p> <p>as well.</p> <p></p> <p> The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</p> <p>`What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. `They</p> <p>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in</p> <p>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the</p> <p>trial.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but</p> <p>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in</p> <p>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked</p> <p>anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their</p> <p>shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'</p> <p>on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them</p> <p>didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his</p> <p>neighbour to tell him. `A nice muddle their slates'll be in</p> <p>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,</p> <p>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got</p> <p>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it</p> <p>away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was</p> <p>Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of</p> <p>it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write</p> <p>with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very</p> <p>little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p> <p></p> <p> `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and</p> <p>then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--</p> <p></p> <p> `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,</p> <p> All on a summer day:</p> <p> The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,</p> <p> And took them quite away!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. `There's</p> <p>a great deal to come before that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit</p> <p>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First</p> <p>witness!'</p> <p></p> <p> The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in</p> <p>one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. `I beg</p> <p>pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in: but I</p> <p>hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to have finished,' said the King. `When did you</p> <p>begin?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into</p> <p>the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. `Fourteenth of March, I</p> <p>think it was,' he said.</p> <p></p> <p> `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury</p> <p>eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then</p> <p>added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</p> <p></p> <p> `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who</p> <p>instantly made a memorandum of the fact.</p> <p></p> <p> `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;</p> <p>`I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'</p> <p></p> <p> Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or</p> <p>I'll have you executed on the spot.'</p> <p></p> <p> This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept</p> <p>shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the</p> <p>Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his</p> <p>teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.</p> <p></p> <p> Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which</p> <p>puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was</p> <p>beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she</p> <p>would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she</p> <p>decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for</p> <p>her.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was</p> <p>sitting next to her. `I can hardly breathe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: `I'm growing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: `you know</p> <p>you're growing too.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:</p> <p>`not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily</p> <p>and crossed over to the other side of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to</p> <p>one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the</p> <p>singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter</p> <p>trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have</p> <p>you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a</p> <p>trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week</p> <p>or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and</p> <p>the twinkling of the tea--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.</p> <p>`Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things</p> <p>twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did!' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `I deny it!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `He denies it,' said the King: `leave out that part.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,</p> <p>looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the</p> <p>Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</p> <p></p> <p> `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-</p> <p>and-butter--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you</p> <p>executed.'</p> <p></p> <p> The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,</p> <p>and went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he</p> <p>began.</p> <p></p> <p> `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately</p> <p>suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a</p> <p>hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had</p> <p>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:</p> <p>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat</p> <p>upon it.)</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've so often</p> <p>read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some</p> <p>attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the</p> <p>officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant</p> <p>till now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'</p> <p>continued the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as</p> <p>it is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.</p> <p></p> <p> Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. `Now we</p> <p>shall get on better.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious</p> <p>look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</p> <p></p> <p> `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the</p> <p>court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.</p> <p></p> <p> `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one</p> <p>of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the</p> <p>officer could get to the door.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the next witness!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the</p> <p>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before</p> <p>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began</p> <p>sneezing all at once.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shan't,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a</p> <p>low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy</p> <p>air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till</p> <p>his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What</p> <p>are tarts made of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead that</p> <p>Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch</p> <p>him! Off with his whiskers!'</p> <p></p> <p> For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the</p> <p>Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down</p> <p>again, the cook had disappeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.</p> <p>`Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the</p> <p>Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.</p> <p>It quite makes my forehead ache!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,</p> <p>feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,</p> <p>`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.</p> <p>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top</p> <p>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XII</p> <p></p> <p> Alice's Evidence</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the</p> <p>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she</p> <p>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with</p> <p>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads</p> <p>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding</p> <p>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset</p> <p>the week before.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great</p> <p>dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,</p> <p>for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and</p> <p>she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once</p> <p>and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</p> <p></p> <p> `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave</p> <p>voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--</p> <p>ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as</p> <p>he said do.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she</p> <p>had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing</p> <p>was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable</p> <p>to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that</p> <p>it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it</p> <p>would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of</p> <p>being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and</p> <p>handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write</p> <p>out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed</p> <p>too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,</p> <p>gazing up into the roof of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you know about this business?' the King said to</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.</p> <p>They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when</p> <p>the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,</p> <p>of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and</p> <p>making faces at him as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and</p> <p>went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--</p> <p>unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word</p> <p>sounded best.</p> <p></p> <p> Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some</p> <p>`unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to</p> <p>look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she</p> <p>thought to herself.</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily</p> <p>writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out</p> <p>from his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE</p> <p>HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'</p> <p></p> <p> Everybody looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You are,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides,</p> <p>that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</p> <p>`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said</p> <p>the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has</p> <p>just been picked up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What's in it?' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems</p> <p>to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was</p> <p>written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,</p> <p>there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper</p> <p>as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set</p> <p>of verses.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of</p> <p>the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the</p> <p>queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)</p> <p></p> <p> `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.</p> <p>(The jury all brightened up again.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and</p> <p>they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the</p> <p>matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd</p> <p>have signed your name like an honest man.'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the</p> <p>first really clever thing the King had said that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't</p> <p>even know what they're about!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Read them,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,</p> <p>please your Majesty?' he asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on</p> <p>till you come to the end: then stop.'</p> <p></p> <p> These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--</p> <p></p> <p> `They told me you had been to her,</p> <p> And mentioned me to him:</p> <p> She gave me a good character,</p> <p> But said I could not swim.</p> <p></p> <p> He sent them word I had not gone</p> <p> (We know it to be true):</p> <p> If she should push the matter on,</p> <p> What would become of you?</p> <p></p> <p> I gave her one, they gave him two,</p> <p> You gave us three or more;</p> <p> They all returned from him to you,</p> <p> Though they were mine before.</p> <p></p> <p> If I or she should chance to be</p> <p> Involved in this affair,</p> <p> He trusts to you to set them free,</p> <p> Exactly as we were.</p> <p></p> <p> My notion was that you had been</p> <p> (Before she had this fit)</p> <p> An obstacle that came between</p> <p> Him, and ourselves, and it.</p> <p></p> <p> Don't let him know she liked them best,</p> <p> For this must ever be</p> <p> A secret, kept from all the rest,</p> <p> Between yourself and me.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'</p> <p>said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'</p> <p></p> <p> `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had</p> <p>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit</p> <p>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't</p> <p>believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'</p> <p></p> <p> The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe</p> <p>there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to</p> <p>explain the paper.</p> <p></p> <p> `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a</p> <p>world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And</p> <p>yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his</p> <p>knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some</p> <p>meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you</p> <p>can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.</p> <p>(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)</p> <p></p> <p> `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering</p> <p>over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's</p> <p>the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,</p> <p>that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to</p> <p>the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.</p> <p>Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my</p> <p>dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the</p> <p>Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off</p> <p>writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no</p> <p>mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was</p> <p>trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round</p> <p>the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and</p> <p>everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the</p> <p>King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having</p> <p>the sentence first!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't!' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</p> <p>Nobody moved.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full</p> <p>size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'</p> <p></p> <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying</p> <p>down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half</p> <p>of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on</p> <p>the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently</p> <p>brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the</p> <p>trees upon her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long</p> <p>sleep you've had!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told</p> <p>her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange</p> <p>Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and</p> <p>when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a</p> <p>curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's</p> <p>getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she</p> <p>ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</p> <p></p> <p> But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her</p> <p>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of</p> <p>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began</p> <p>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--</p> <p></p> <p> First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the</p> <p>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes</p> <p>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her</p> <p>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back</p> <p>the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and</p> <p>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place</p> <p>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little</p> <p>sister's dream.</p> <p></p> <p> The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried</p> <p>by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the</p> <p>neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as</p> <p>the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,</p> <p>and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate</p> <p>guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the</p> <p>Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once</p> <p>more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's</p> <p>slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,</p> <p>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable</p> <p>Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in</p> <p>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and</p> <p>all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only</p> <p>rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the</p> <p>reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-</p> <p>bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd</p> <p>boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and</p> <p>all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the</p> <p>confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the</p> <p>cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's</p> <p>heavy sobs.</p> <p></p> <p> Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of</p> <p>hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how</p> <p>she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and</p> <p>loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about</p> <p>her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager</p> <p>with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of</p> <p>Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their</p> <p>simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,</p> <p>remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</p> <p></p> <p> THE END</p>
ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND</p> <p></p> <p> Lewis Carroll</p> <p></p> <p> THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER I</p> <p></p> <p> Down the Rabbit-Hole</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister</p> <p>on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had</p> <p>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no</p> <p>pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'</p> <p>thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'</p> <p></p> <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,</p> <p>for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether</p> <p>the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble</p> <p>of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White</p> <p>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p> <p></p> <p> There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice</p> <p>think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to</p> <p>itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought</p> <p>it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have</p> <p>wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);</p> <p>but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-</p> <p>POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to</p> <p>her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never</p> <p>before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to</p> <p>take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the</p> <p>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop</p> <p>down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p> <p></p> <p> In another moment down went Alice after it, never once</p> <p>considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,</p> <p>and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a</p> <p>moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself</p> <p>falling down a very deep well.</p> <p></p> <p> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she</p> <p>had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to</p> <p>wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look</p> <p>down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to</p> <p>see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and</p> <p>noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;</p> <p>here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She</p> <p>took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was</p> <p>labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it</p> <p>was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing</p> <p>somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she</p> <p>fell past it.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I</p> <p>shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll</p> <p>all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,</p> <p>even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely</p> <p>true.)</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! `I</p> <p>wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.</p> <p>`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let</p> <p>me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,</p> <p>you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her</p> <p>lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good</p> <p>opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to</p> <p>listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,</p> <p>that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude</p> <p>or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,</p> <p>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to</p> <p>say.)</p> <p></p> <p> Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right</p> <p>THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the</p> <p>people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I</p> <p>think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this</p> <p>time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall</p> <p>have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.</p> <p>Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried</p> <p>to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling</p> <p>through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what</p> <p>an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll</p> <p>never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon</p> <p>began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I</p> <p>should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember</p> <p>her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were</p> <p>down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but</p> <p>you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.</p> <p>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get</p> <p>rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of</p> <p>way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do</p> <p>bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either</p> <p>question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt</p> <p>that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she</p> <p>was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very</p> <p>earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a</p> <p>bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of</p> <p>sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a</p> <p>moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her</p> <p>was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in</p> <p>sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:</p> <p>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it</p> <p>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late</p> <p>it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the</p> <p>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found</p> <p>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps</p> <p>hanging from the roof.</p> <p></p> <p> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;</p> <p>and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the</p> <p>other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,</p> <p>wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of</p> <p>solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,</p> <p>and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the</p> <p>doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or</p> <p>the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of</p> <p>them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low</p> <p>curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little</p> <p>door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key</p> <p>in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p> <p></p> <p> Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small</p> <p>passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and</p> <p>looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</p> <p>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about</p> <p>among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but</p> <p>she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if</p> <p>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of</p> <p>very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish</p> <p>I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only</p> <p>know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things</p> <p>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few</p> <p>things indeed were really impossible.</p> <p></p> <p> There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she</p> <p>went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on</p> <p>it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like</p> <p>telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which</p> <p>certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck</p> <p>of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'</p> <p>beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p> <p></p> <p> It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little</p> <p>Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look</p> <p>first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';</p> <p>for she had read several nice little histories about children who</p> <p>had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant</p> <p>things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules</p> <p>their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker</p> <p>will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your</p> <p>finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had</p> <p>never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked</p> <p>`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or</p> <p>later.</p> <p></p> <p> However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured</p> <p>to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort</p> <p>of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast</p> <p>turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished</p> <p>it off.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up</p> <p>like a telescope.'</p> <p></p> <p> And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and</p> <p>her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right</p> <p>size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.</p> <p>First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was</p> <p>going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about</p> <p>this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my</p> <p>going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be</p> <p>like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is</p> <p>like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember</p> <p>ever having seen such a thing.</p> <p></p> <p> After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided</p> <p>on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!</p> <p>when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the</p> <p>little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,</p> <p>she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it</p> <p>quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb</p> <p>up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;</p> <p>and when she had tired herself out with trying,</p> <p>the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to</p> <p>herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'</p> <p>She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very</p> <p>seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so</p> <p>severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered</p> <p>trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game</p> <p>of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious</p> <p>child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no</p> <p>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why,</p> <p>there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable</p> <p>person!'</p> <p></p> <p> Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under</p> <p>the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on</p> <p>which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.</p> <p>`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,</p> <p>I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep</p> <p>under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I</p> <p>don't care which happens!'</p> <p></p> <p> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which</p> <p>way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to</p> <p>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to</p> <p>find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally</p> <p>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the</p> <p>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,</p> <p>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the</p> <p>common way.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER II</p> <p></p> <p> The Pool of Tears</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much</p> <p>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good</p> <p>English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that</p> <p>ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her</p> <p>feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so</p> <p>far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on</p> <p>your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't</p> <p>be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself</p> <p>about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be</p> <p>kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the</p> <p>way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of</p> <p>boots every Christmas.'</p> <p></p> <p> And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.</p> <p>`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll</p> <p>seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the</p> <p>directions will look!</p> <p></p> <p> ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</p> <p> HEARTHRUG,</p> <p> NEAR THE FENDER,</p> <p> (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).</p> <p></p> <p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in</p> <p>fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took</p> <p>up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p> <p></p> <p> Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one</p> <p>side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get</p> <p>through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to</p> <p>cry again.</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great</p> <p>girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in</p> <p>this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all</p> <p>the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool</p> <p>all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the</p> <p>hall.</p> <p></p> <p> After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the</p> <p>distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p> <p>It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a</p> <p>pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the</p> <p>other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to</p> <p>himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she</p> <p>be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate</p> <p>that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit</p> <p>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,</p> <p>sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid</p> <p>gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard</p> <p>as he could go.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very</p> <p>hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:</p> <p>`Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday</p> <p>things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in</p> <p>the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this</p> <p>morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little</p> <p>different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in</p> <p>the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began</p> <p>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age</p> <p>as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of</p> <p>them.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such</p> <p>long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm</p> <p>sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,</p> <p>oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,</p> <p>and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the</p> <p>things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,</p> <p>and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!</p> <p>I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the</p> <p>Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.</p> <p>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,</p> <p>and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been</p> <p>changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'</p> <p>and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,</p> <p>and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and</p> <p>strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--</p> <p></p> <p> `How doth the little crocodile</p> <p> Improve his shining tail,</p> <p> And pour the waters of the Nile</p> <p> On every golden scale!</p> <p></p> <p> `How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p> <p> How neatly spread his claws,</p> <p> And welcome little fishes in</p> <p> With gently smiling jaws!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and</p> <p>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel</p> <p>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little</p> <p>house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so</p> <p>many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm</p> <p>Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their</p> <p>heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look</p> <p>up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I</p> <p>like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down</p> <p>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a</p> <p>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads</p> <p>down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was</p> <p>surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little</p> <p>white kid gloves while she was talking. `How CAN I have done</p> <p>that?' she thought. `I must be growing small again.' She got up</p> <p>and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,</p> <p>as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,</p> <p>and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the</p> <p>cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it</p> <p>hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p> <p></p> <p>`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at</p> <p>the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in</p> <p>existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed</p> <p>back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut</p> <p>again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as</p> <p>before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,</p> <p>`for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare</p> <p>it's too bad, that it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another</p> <p>moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first</p> <p>idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that</p> <p>case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had</p> <p>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general</p> <p>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find</p> <p>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in</p> <p>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and</p> <p>behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that</p> <p>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine</p> <p>feet high.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,</p> <p>trying to find her way out. `I shall be punished for it now, I</p> <p>suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer</p> <p>thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a</p> <p>little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at</p> <p>first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then</p> <p>she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that</p> <p>it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this</p> <p>mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should</p> <p>think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in</p> <p>trying.' So she began: `O Mouse, do you know the way out of</p> <p>this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'</p> <p>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:</p> <p>she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having</p> <p>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a</p> <p>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather</p> <p>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little</p> <p>eyes, but it said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I</p> <p>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the</p> <p>Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had</p> <p>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she</p> <p>began again: `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in</p> <p>her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the</p> <p>water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg</p> <p>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the</p> <p>poor animal's feelings. `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate</p> <p>voice. `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: `don't be</p> <p>angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:</p> <p>I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</p> <p>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,</p> <p>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so</p> <p>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and</p> <p>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital</p> <p>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,</p> <p>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt</p> <p>certain it must be really offended. `We won't talk about her any</p> <p>more if you'd rather not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end</p> <p>of his tail. `As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family</p> <p>always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear</p> <p>the name again!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the</p> <p>subject of conversation. `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'</p> <p>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: `There is</p> <p>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</p> <p>A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly</p> <p>brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and</p> <p>it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I</p> <p>can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you</p> <p>know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!</p> <p>He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the</p> <p>Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and</p> <p>making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p> <p></p> <p> So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear! Do come back</p> <p>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't</p> <p>like them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam</p> <p>slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice</p> <p>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to</p> <p>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll</p> <p>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded</p> <p>with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a</p> <p>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious</p> <p>creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the</p> <p>shore.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER III</p> <p></p> <p> A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the</p> <p>bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their</p> <p>fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and</p> <p>uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they</p> <p>had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed</p> <p>quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with</p> <p>them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had</p> <p>quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,</p> <p>and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';</p> <p>and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,</p> <p>and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no</p> <p>more to be said.</p> <p></p> <p> At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among</p> <p>them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL</p> <p>soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large</p> <p>ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes</p> <p>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad</p> <p>cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?</p> <p>This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!</p> <p>"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was</p> <p>soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been</p> <p>of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very</p> <p>politely: `Did you speak?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought you did,' said the Mouse. `--I proceed. "Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:</p> <p>and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found</p> <p>it advisable--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.</p> <p></p> <p> `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: `of course you</p> <p>know what "it" means.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said</p> <p>the Duck: `it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is,</p> <p>what did the archbishop find?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,</p> <p>`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William</p> <p>and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was</p> <p>moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you</p> <p>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it</p> <p>spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: `it doesn't</p> <p>seem to dry me at all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I</p> <p>move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more</p> <p>energetic remedies--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak English!' said the Eaglet. `I don't know the meaning of</p> <p>half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do</p> <p>either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:</p> <p>some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p> <p></p> <p> `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,</p> <p>`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much</p> <p>to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY</p> <p>ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'</p> <p>(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter</p> <p>day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p> <p></p> <p> First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the</p> <p>exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party</p> <p>were placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One,</p> <p>two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,</p> <p>and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know</p> <p>when the race was over. However, when they had been running half</p> <p>an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called</p> <p>out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,</p> <p>and asking, `But who has won?'</p> <p></p> <p> This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of</p> <p>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon</p> <p>its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,</p> <p>in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At</p> <p>last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have</p> <p>prizes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices</p> <p>asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with</p> <p>one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,</p> <p>calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand</p> <p>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt</p> <p>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</p> <p>There was exactly one a-piece all round.</p> <p></p> <p> `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have</p> <p>you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.</p> <p></p> <p> Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo</p> <p>solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of</p> <p>this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short</p> <p>speech, they all cheered.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked</p> <p>so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not</p> <p>think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,</p> <p>looking as solemn as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise</p> <p>and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not</p> <p>taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on</p> <p>the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again</p> <p>in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p> <p></p> <p> `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,</p> <p>`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half</p> <p>afraid that it would be offended again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to</p> <p>Alice, and sighing.</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with</p> <p>wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And</p> <p>she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so</p> <p>that her idea of the tale was something like this:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Fury said to a</p> <p> mouse, That he</p> <p> met in the</p> <p> house,</p> <p> "Let us</p> <p> both go to</p> <p> law: I will</p> <p> prosecute</p> <p> YOU. --Come,</p> <p> I'll take no</p> <p> denial; We</p> <p> must have a</p> <p> trial: For</p> <p> really this</p> <p> morning I've</p> <p> nothing</p> <p> to do."</p> <p> Said the</p> <p> mouse to the</p> <p> cur, "Such</p> <p> a trial,</p> <p> dear Sir,</p> <p> With</p> <p> no jury</p> <p> or judge,</p> <p> would be</p> <p> wasting</p> <p> our</p> <p> breath."</p> <p> "I'll be</p> <p> judge, I'll</p> <p> be jury,"</p> <p> Said</p> <p> cunning</p> <p> old Fury:</p> <p> "I'll</p> <p> try the</p> <p> whole</p> <p> cause,</p> <p> and</p> <p> condemn</p> <p> you</p> <p> to</p> <p> death."'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.</p> <p>`What are you thinking of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to</p> <p>the fifth bend, I think?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up</p> <p>and walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily</p> <p>offended, you know!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse only growled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after</p> <p>it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but</p> <p>the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little</p> <p>quicker.</p> <p></p> <p> `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it</p> <p>was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of</p> <p>saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you</p> <p>never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the</p> <p>young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the</p> <p>patience of an oyster!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,</p> <p>addressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'</p> <p>said the Lory.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about</p> <p>her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for</p> <p>catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her</p> <p>after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look</p> <p>at it!'</p> <p></p> <p> This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</p> <p>Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began</p> <p>wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be</p> <p>getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary</p> <p>called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my</p> <p>dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts</p> <p>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a</p> <p>melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm</p> <p>sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I</p> <p>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice</p> <p>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</p> <p>In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of</p> <p>footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping</p> <p>that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to</p> <p>finish his story.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IV</p> <p></p> <p> The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;</p> <p>and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!</p> <p>Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me</p> <p>executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have</p> <p>dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was</p> <p>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she</p> <p>very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were</p> <p>nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her</p> <p>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and</p> <p>the little door, had vanished completely.</p> <p></p> <p> Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,</p> <p>and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE</p> <p>you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of</p> <p>gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened</p> <p>that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without</p> <p>trying to explain the mistake it had made.</p> <p></p> <p> `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.</p> <p>`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd</p> <p>better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'</p> <p>As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door</p> <p>of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'</p> <p>engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried</p> <p>upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,</p> <p>and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and</p> <p>gloves.</p> <p></p> <p> `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going</p> <p>messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on</p> <p>messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that</p> <p>would happen: `"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready</p> <p>for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see</p> <p>that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went</p> <p>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering</p> <p>people about like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with</p> <p>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two</p> <p>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and</p> <p>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when</p> <p>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-</p> <p>glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'</p> <p>but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know</p> <p>SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,</p> <p>`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this</p> <p>bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for</p> <p>really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'</p> <p></p> <p> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:</p> <p>before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing</p> <p>against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being</p> <p>broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself</p> <p>`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I</p> <p>can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so</p> <p>much!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and</p> <p>growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in</p> <p>another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried</p> <p>the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the</p> <p>other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,</p> <p>as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one</p> <p>foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,</p> <p>whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'</p> <p></p> <p> Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full</p> <p>effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,</p> <p>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting</p> <p>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one</p> <p>wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about</p> <p>by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that</p> <p>rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,</p> <p>this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!</p> <p>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing</p> <p>never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There</p> <p>ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when</p> <p>I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more</p> <p>HERE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I</p> <p>am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--</p> <p>but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you</p> <p>learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no</p> <p>room at all for any lesson-books!'</p> <p></p> <p> And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,</p> <p>and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few</p> <p>minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves</p> <p>this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the</p> <p>stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and</p> <p>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she</p> <p>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no</p> <p>reason to be afraid of it.</p> <p></p> <p> Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;</p> <p>but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed</p> <p>hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it</p> <p>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she</p> <p>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly</p> <p>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not</p> <p>get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,</p> <p>and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was</p> <p>just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something</p> <p>of the sort.</p> <p></p> <p> Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are</p> <p>you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then</p> <p>I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!</p> <p>Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')</p> <p></p> <p> `An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it</p> <p>fills the whole window!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it</p> <p>away!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear</p> <p>whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer</p> <p>honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at</p> <p>last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in</p> <p>the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more</p> <p>sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there</p> <p>must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for</p> <p>pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I</p> <p>don't want to stay in here any longer!'</p> <p></p> <p> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at</p> <p>last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a</p> <p>good many voices all talking together: she made out the words:</p> <p>`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;</p> <p>Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up</p> <p>at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half</p> <p>high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--</p> <p>Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind</p> <p>that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud</p> <p>crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go</p> <p>down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,</p> <p>then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to</p> <p>go down the chimney!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said</p> <p>Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!</p> <p>I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is</p> <p>narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'</p> <p></p> <p> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and</p> <p>waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what</p> <p>sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close</p> <p>above her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one</p> <p>sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes</p> <p>Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the</p> <p>hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold</p> <p>up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?</p> <p>What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'</p> <p></p> <p> Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'</p> <p>thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm</p> <p>better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know</p> <p>is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes</p> <p>like a sky-rocket!'</p> <p></p> <p> `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and</p> <p>Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do. I'll set</p> <p>Dinah at you!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to</p> <p>herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any</p> <p>sense, they'd take the roof off.' After a minute or two, they</p> <p>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A</p> <p>barrowful will do, to begin with.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to</p> <p>doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came</p> <p>rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.</p> <p>`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,</p> <p>`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead</p> <p>silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all</p> <p>turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright</p> <p>idea came into her head. `If I eat one of these cakes,' she</p> <p>thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it</p> <p>can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I</p> <p>suppose.'</p> <p></p> <p> So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find</p> <p>that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small</p> <p>enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and</p> <p>found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.</p> <p>The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by</p> <p>two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.</p> <p>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she</p> <p>ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a</p> <p>thick wood.</p> <p></p> <p> `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she</p> <p>wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;</p> <p>and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</p> <p>I think that will be the best plan.'</p> <p></p> <p> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and</p> <p>simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the</p> <p>smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering</p> <p>about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over</p> <p>her head made her look up in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round</p> <p>eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</p> <p>`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried</p> <p>hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the</p> <p>time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it</p> <p>would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</p> <p></p> <p> Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of</p> <p>stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped</p> <p>into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,</p> <p>and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice</p> <p>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run</p> <p>over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy</p> <p>made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in</p> <p>its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very</p> <p>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every</p> <p>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle</p> <p>again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the</p> <p>stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long</p> <p>way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat</p> <p>down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its</p> <p>mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p> <p></p> <p> This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;</p> <p>so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out</p> <p>of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the</p> <p>distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she</p> <p>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself</p> <p>with one of the leaves: `I should have liked teaching it tricks</p> <p>very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh</p> <p>dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let</p> <p>me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or</p> <p>drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'</p> <p></p> <p> The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round</p> <p>her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see</p> <p>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under</p> <p>the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,</p> <p>about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under</p> <p>it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her</p> <p>that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.</p> <p></p> <p> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of</p> <p>the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large</p> <p>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,</p> <p>quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice</p> <p>of her or of anything else.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER V</p> <p></p> <p> Advice from a Caterpillar</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in</p> <p>silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice</p> <p>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--</p> <p>at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think</p> <p>I must have been changed several times since then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</p> <p>`Explain yourself!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because</p> <p>I'm not myself, you see.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very</p> <p>politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and</p> <p>being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but</p> <p>when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you</p> <p>know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll</p> <p>feel it a little queer, won't you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;</p> <p>`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. `Who are YOU?'</p> <p></p> <p> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the</p> <p>conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's</p> <p>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,</p> <p>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not</p> <p>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in</p> <p>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. `I've something</p> <p>important to say!'</p> <p></p> <p> This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as</p> <p>she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else</p> <p>to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth</p> <p>hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but</p> <p>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth</p> <p>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as</p> <p>I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it</p> <p>all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice folded her hands, and began:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,</p> <p> `And your hair has become very white;</p> <p> And yet you incessantly stand on your head--</p> <p> Do you think, at your age, it is right?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,</p> <p> `I feared it might injure the brain;</p> <p> But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,</p> <p> Why, I do it again and again.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,</p> <p> And have grown most uncommonly fat;</p> <p> Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--</p> <p> Pray, what is the reason of that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</p> <p> `I kept all my limbs very supple</p> <p> By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--</p> <p> Allow me to sell you a couple?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak</p> <p> For anything tougher than suet;</p> <p> Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--</p> <p> Pray how did you manage to do it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,</p> <p> And argued each case with my wife;</p> <p> And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,</p> <p> Has lasted the rest of my life.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose</p> <p> That your eye was as steady as ever;</p> <p> Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--</p> <p> What made you so awfully clever?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'</p> <p> Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!</p> <p> Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?</p> <p> Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the</p> <p>words have got altered.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.</p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar was the first to speak.</p> <p></p> <p> `What size do you want to be?' it asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;</p> <p>`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in</p> <p>her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you</p> <p>wouldn't mind,' said Alice: `three inches is such a wretched</p> <p>height to be.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three</p> <p>inches high).</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</p> <p>And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so</p> <p>easily offended!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it</p> <p>put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</p> <p></p> <p> This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</p> <p>In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got</p> <p>down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely</p> <p>remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and</p> <p>the other side will make you grow shorter.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had</p> <p>asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a</p> <p>minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as</p> <p>it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</p> <p>However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they</p> <p>would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p> <p></p> <p> `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a</p> <p>little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment</p> <p>she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her</p> <p>foot!</p> <p></p> <p> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but</p> <p>she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking</p> <p>rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.</p> <p>Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was</p> <p>hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and</p> <p>managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of</p> <p>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she</p> <p>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could</p> <p>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which</p> <p>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay</p> <p>far below her.</p> <p></p> <p> `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. `And where</p> <p>HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I</p> <p>can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no</p> <p>result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the</p> <p>distant green leaves.</p> <p></p> <p> As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her</p> <p>head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted</p> <p>to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,</p> <p>like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a</p> <p>graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which</p> <p>she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she</p> <p>had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a</p> <p>hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating</p> <p>her violently with its wings.</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. `Let me alone!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more</p> <p>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every</p> <p>way, and nothing seems to suit them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've</p> <p>tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but</p> <p>those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no</p> <p>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</p> <p></p> <p> `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the</p> <p>Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and</p> <p>day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was</p> <p>beginning to see its meaning.</p> <p></p> <p> `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued</p> <p>the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was</p> <p>thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come</p> <p>wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. `I'm a--I'm</p> <p>a--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're</p> <p>trying to invent something!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she</p> <p>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the</p> <p>deepest contempt. `I've seen a good many little girls in my</p> <p>time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a</p> <p>serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be</p> <p>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very</p> <p>truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as</p> <p>serpents do, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why</p> <p>then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent</p> <p>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of</p> <p>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and</p> <p>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a</p> <p>serpent?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm</p> <p>not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't</p> <p>want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it</p> <p>settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the</p> <p>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled</p> <p>among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and</p> <p>untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the</p> <p>pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very</p> <p>carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and</p> <p>growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had</p> <p>succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p> <p></p> <p> It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,</p> <p>that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a</p> <p>few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come,</p> <p>there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes</p> <p>are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to</p> <p>another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next</p> <p>thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be</p> <p>done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an</p> <p>open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</p> <p>`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come</p> <p>upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their</p> <p>wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did</p> <p>not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself</p> <p>down to nine inches high.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VI</p> <p></p> <p> Pig and Pepper</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and</p> <p>wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came</p> <p>running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman</p> <p>because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only,</p> <p>she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door</p> <p>with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,</p> <p>with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,</p> <p>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their</p> <p>heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and</p> <p>crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great</p> <p>letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to</p> <p>the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess. An</p> <p>invitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman</p> <p>repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the</p> <p>words a little, `From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess</p> <p>to play croquet.'</p> <p></p> <p> Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled</p> <p>together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into</p> <p>the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped</p> <p>out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the</p> <p>ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and</p> <p>that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the</p> <p>door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise</p> <p>inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was</p> <p>a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling</p> <p>and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish</p> <p>or kettle had been broken to pieces.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'</p> <p></p> <p> `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went</p> <p>on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us. For</p> <p>instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let</p> <p>you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time</p> <p>he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. `But</p> <p>perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so</p> <p>VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might</p> <p>answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate</p> <p>came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just</p> <p>grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees</p> <p>behind him.</p> <p></p> <p> `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,</p> <p>exactly as if nothing had happened.</p> <p></p> <p> `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. `That's the</p> <p>first question, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.</p> <p>`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the</p> <p>creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for</p> <p>repeating his remark, with variations. `I shall sit here,' he</p> <p>said, `on and off, for days and days.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what am I to do?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:</p> <p>`he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.</p> <p></p> <p> The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of</p> <p>smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a</p> <p>three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was</p> <p>leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to</p> <p>be full of soup.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to</p> <p>herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p> <p></p> <p> There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the</p> <p>Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was</p> <p>sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The</p> <p>only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,</p> <p>and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from</p> <p>ear to ear.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for</p> <p>she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to</p> <p>speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!'</p> <p></p> <p> She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice</p> <p>quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed</p> <p>to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I</p> <p>didn't know that cats COULD grin.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,</p> <p>feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</p> <p></p> <p> `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought</p> <p>it would be as well to introduce some other subject of</p> <p>conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took</p> <p>the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work</p> <p>throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby</p> <p>--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,</p> <p>plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when</p> <p>they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it</p> <p>was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up</p> <p>and down in an agony of terror. `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS</p> <p>nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very</p> <p>nearly carried it off.</p> <p></p> <p> `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a</p> <p>hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it</p> <p>does.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very</p> <p>glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her</p> <p>knowledge. `Just think of what work it would make with the day</p> <p>and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn</p> <p>round on its axis--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant</p> <p>to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and</p> <p>seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: `Twenty-four</p> <p>hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide</p> <p>figures!' And with that she began nursing her child again,</p> <p>singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a</p> <p>violent shake at the end of every line:</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak roughly to your little boy,</p> <p> And beat him when he sneezes:</p> <p> He only does it to annoy,</p> <p> Because he knows it teases.'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> (In which the cook and the baby joined):--</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept</p> <p>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing</p> <p>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I speak severely to my boy,</p> <p> I beat him when he sneezes;</p> <p> For he can thoroughly enjoy</p> <p> The pepper when he pleases!'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said</p> <p>to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. `I must go and</p> <p>get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of</p> <p>the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,</p> <p>but it just missed her.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-</p> <p>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all</p> <p>directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor</p> <p>little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,</p> <p>and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,</p> <p>so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much</p> <p>as she could do to hold it.</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,</p> <p>(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep</p> <p>tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its</p> <p>undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. `IF I</p> <p>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure</p> <p>to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it</p> <p>behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing</p> <p>grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). `Don't</p> <p>grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing</p> <p>yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into</p> <p>its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no</p> <p>doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout</p> <p>than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for</p> <p>a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at</p> <p>all. `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked</p> <p>into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</p> <p></p> <p> No, there were no tears. `If you're going to turn into a pig,</p> <p>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do</p> <p>with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or</p> <p>grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for</p> <p>some while in silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I</p> <p>to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted</p> <p>again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some</p> <p>alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was</p> <p>neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be</p> <p>quite absurd for her to carry it further.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to</p> <p>see it trot away quietly into the wood. `If it had grown up,'</p> <p>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:</p> <p>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began</p> <p>thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as</p> <p>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right</p> <p>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing</p> <p>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-</p> <p>natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great</p> <p>many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p> <p></p> <p> `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at</p> <p>all know whether it would like the name: however, it only</p> <p>grinned a little wider. `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought</p> <p>Alice, and she went on. `Would you tell me, please, which way I</p> <p>ought to go from here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said</p> <p>the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't much care where--' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk</p> <p>long enough.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another</p> <p>question. `What sort of people live about here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,</p> <p>`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,</p> <p>`lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.</p> <p>I'm mad. You're mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on</p> <p>`And how do you know that you're mad?'</p> <p></p> <p> `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad. You grant</p> <p>that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I suppose so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's</p> <p>angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm</p> <p>pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call it what you like,' said the Cat. `Do you play croquet</p> <p>with the Queen to-day?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been</p> <p>invited yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used</p> <p>to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place</p> <p>where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.</p> <p></p> <p> `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. `I'd</p> <p>nearly forgotten to ask.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had</p> <p>come back in a natural way.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it</p> <p>did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the</p> <p>direction in which the March Hare was said to live. `I've seen</p> <p>hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be</p> <p>much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be</p> <p>raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.' As she said</p> <p>this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a</p> <p>branch of a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep</p> <p>appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'</p> <p></p> <p> `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,</p> <p>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,</p> <p>which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever</p> <p>saw in my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the</p> <p>house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house,</p> <p>because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was</p> <p>thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not</p> <p>like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand</p> <p>bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even</p> <p>then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself</p> <p>`Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd</p> <p>gone to see the Hatter instead!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VII</p> <p></p> <p> A Mad Tea-Party</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,</p> <p>and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a</p> <p>Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two</p> <p>were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking</p> <p>over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p> <p></p> <p> The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded</p> <p>together at one corner of it: `No room! No room!' they cried</p> <p>out when they saw Alice coming. `There's PLENTY of room!' said</p> <p>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one</p> <p>end of the table.</p> <p></p> <p> `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it</p> <p>but tea. `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice</p> <p>angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being</p> <p>invited,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a</p> <p>great many more than three.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been</p> <p>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was</p> <p>his first speech.</p> <p></p> <p> `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said</p> <p>with some severity; `it's very rude.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all</p> <p>he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. `I'm glad</p> <p>they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she</p> <p>added aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'</p> <p>said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what</p> <p>I say--that's the same thing, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. `You might just</p> <p>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat</p> <p>what I see"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I</p> <p>like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to</p> <p>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the</p> <p>same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the</p> <p>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,</p> <p>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and</p> <p>writing-desks, which wasn't much.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter was the first to break the silence. `What day of</p> <p>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his</p> <p>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking</p> <p>it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. `I told you butter</p> <p>wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March</p> <p>Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter</p> <p>grumbled: `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'</p> <p></p> <p> The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then</p> <p>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he</p> <p>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It</p> <p>was the BEST butter, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</p> <p>`What a funny watch!' she remarked. `It tells the day of the</p> <p>month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. `Does YOUR watch tell</p> <p>you what year it is?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: `but that's</p> <p>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to</p> <p>have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</p> <p>`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she</p> <p>could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured</p> <p>a little hot tea upon its nose.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without</p> <p>opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to</p> <p>remark myself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to</p> <p>Alice again.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I give it up,' Alice replied: `what's the answer?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nor I,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice sighed wearily. `I think you might do something better</p> <p>with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that</p> <p>have no answers.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you</p> <p>wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head</p> <p>contemptuously. `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: `but I know I have to</p> <p>beat time when I learn music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. `He won't stand</p> <p>beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do</p> <p>almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose</p> <p>it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:</p> <p>you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the</p> <p>clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'</p> <p></p> <p> (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a</p> <p>whisper.)</p> <p></p> <p> `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:</p> <p>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: `but you could keep</p> <p>it to half-past one as long as you liked.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter shook his head mournfully. `Not I!' he replied.</p> <p>`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'</p> <p>(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the</p> <p>great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing</p> <p></p> <p> "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</p> <p> How I wonder what you're at!"</p> <p></p> <p>You know the song, perhaps?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--</p> <p></p> <p> "Up above the world you fly,</p> <p> Like a tea-tray in the sky.</p> <p> Twinkle, twinkle--"'</p> <p></p> <p>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep</p> <p>`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that</p> <p>they had to pinch it to make it stop.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,</p> <p>`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the</p> <p>time! Off with his head!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,</p> <p>`he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'</p> <p></p> <p> A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so</p> <p>many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always</p> <p>tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice</p> <p>ventured to ask.</p> <p></p> <p> `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,</p> <p>yawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady</p> <p>tells us a story.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at</p> <p>the proposal.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. `Wake up,</p> <p>Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. `I wasn't asleep,' he</p> <p>said in a hoarse, feeble voice: `I heard every word you fellows</p> <p>were saying.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep</p> <p>again before it's done.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the</p> <p>Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,</p> <p>Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great</p> <p>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</p> <p></p> <p> `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a</p> <p>minute or two.</p> <p></p> <p> `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently</p> <p>remarked; `they'd have been ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways</p> <p>of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went</p> <p>on: `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very</p> <p>earnestly.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so</p> <p>I can't take more.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very</p> <p>easy to take MORE than nothing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked</p> <p>triumphantly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped</p> <p>herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the</p> <p>Dormouse, and repeated her question. `Why did they live at the</p> <p>bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and</p> <p>then said, `It was a treacle-well.'</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but</p> <p>the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse</p> <p>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the</p> <p>story for yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt</p> <p>again. I dare say there may be ONE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he</p> <p>consented to go on. `And so these three little sisters--they</p> <p>were learning to draw, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this</p> <p>time.</p> <p></p> <p> `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: `let's all move</p> <p>one place on.'</p> <p></p> <p> He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the</p> <p>March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather</p> <p>unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the</p> <p>only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a</p> <p>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset</p> <p>the milk-jug into his plate.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began</p> <p>very cautiously: `But I don't understand. Where did they draw</p> <p>the treacle from?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so</p> <p>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,</p> <p>stupid?'</p> <p></p> <p> `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not</p> <p>choosing to notice this last remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'</p> <p></p> <p> This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse</p> <p>go on for some time without interrupting it.</p> <p></p> <p> `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and</p> <p>rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew</p> <p>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why with an M?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why not?' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going</p> <p>off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up</p> <p>again with a little shriek, and went on: `--that begins with an</p> <p>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--</p> <p>you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever</p> <p>see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I</p> <p>don't think--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got</p> <p>up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep</p> <p>instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her</p> <p>going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that</p> <p>they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were</p> <p>trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</p> <p></p> <p> `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she</p> <p>picked her way through the wood. `It's the stupidest tea-party I</p> <p>ever was at in all my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a</p> <p>door leading right into it. `That's very curious!' she thought.</p> <p>`But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.'</p> <p>And in she went.</p> <p></p> <p> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the</p> <p>little glass table. `Now, I'll manage better this time,'</p> <p>she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,</p> <p>and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went</p> <p>to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it</p> <p>in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down</p> <p>the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the</p> <p>beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VIII</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's Croquet-Ground</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the</p> <p>roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at</p> <p>it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious</p> <p>thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up</p> <p>to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go</p> <p>splashing paint over me like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged</p> <p>my elbow.'</p> <p></p> <p> On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always</p> <p>lay the blame on others!'</p> <p></p> <p> `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. `I heard the Queen say only</p> <p>yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it</p> <p>was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'</p> <p></p> <p> Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all</p> <p>the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as</p> <p>she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the</p> <p>others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are</p> <p>painting those roses?'</p> <p></p> <p> Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a</p> <p>low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to</p> <p>have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;</p> <p>and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads</p> <p>cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore</p> <p>she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously</p> <p>looking across the garden, called out `The Queen! The Queen!'</p> <p>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon</p> <p>their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice</p> <p>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped</p> <p>like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and</p> <p>feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were</p> <p>ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the</p> <p>soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were</p> <p>ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand</p> <p>in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next</p> <p>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice</p> <p>recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous</p> <p>manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without</p> <p>noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the</p> <p>King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this</p> <p>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on</p> <p>her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember</p> <p>ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,</p> <p>what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people</p> <p>had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'</p> <p>So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p> <p></p> <p> When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped</p> <p>and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'</p> <p>She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,</p> <p>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'</p> <p></p> <p> `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very</p> <p>politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of</p> <p>cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three</p> <p>gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as</p> <p>they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs</p> <p>was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether</p> <p>they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her</p> <p>own children.</p> <p></p> <p> `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</p> <p>`It's no business of MINE.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her</p> <p>for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!</p> <p>Off--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the</p> <p>Queen was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said</p> <p>`Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave</p> <p>`Turn them over!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p> <p></p> <p> `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the</p> <p>three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the</p> <p>King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</p> <p></p> <p> `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. `You make me giddy.'</p> <p>And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you</p> <p>been doing here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,</p> <p>going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the</p> <p>roses. `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,</p> <p>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate</p> <p>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</p> <p></p> <p> `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a</p> <p>large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered</p> <p>about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly</p> <p>marched off after the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers</p> <p>shouted in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's right!' shouted the Queen. `Can you play croquet?'</p> <p></p> <p> The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question</p> <p>was evidently meant for her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes!' shouted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the</p> <p>procession, wondering very much what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.</p> <p>She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously</p> <p>into her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very,' said Alice: `--where's the Duchess?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He</p> <p>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised</p> <p>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and</p> <p>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I didn't,' said Alice: `I don't think it's at all a pity.</p> <p>I said "What for?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a</p> <p>little scream of laughter. `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a</p> <p>frightened tone. `The Queen will hear you! You see, she came</p> <p>rather late, and the Queen said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,</p> <p>and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up</p> <p>against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or</p> <p>two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a</p> <p>curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and</p> <p>furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live</p> <p>flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to</p> <p>stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p> <p></p> <p> The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her</p> <p>flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,</p> <p>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,</p> <p>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened</p> <p>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it</p> <p>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a</p> <p>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:</p> <p>and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,</p> <p>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled</p> <p>itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,</p> <p>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she</p> <p>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers</p> <p>were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the</p> <p>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very</p> <p>difficult game indeed.</p> <p></p> <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns,</p> <p>quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in</p> <p>a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went</p> <p>stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with</p> <p>her head!' about once in a minute.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as</p> <p>yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might</p> <p>happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of</p> <p>me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great</p> <p>wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'</p> <p></p> <p> She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering</p> <p>whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a</p> <p>curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at</p> <p>first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to</p> <p>be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat: now I</p> <p>shall have somebody to talk to.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was</p> <p>mouth enough for it to speak with.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. `It's no</p> <p>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at</p> <p>least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared,</p> <p>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the</p> <p>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The</p> <p>Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and</p> <p>no more of it appeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather</p> <p>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't</p> <p>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in</p> <p>particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and</p> <p>you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;</p> <p>for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next</p> <p>walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have</p> <p>croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it</p> <p>saw mine coming!'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at all,' said Alice: `she's so extremely--' Just then</p> <p>she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so</p> <p>she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while</p> <p>finishing the game.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen smiled and passed on.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and</p> <p>looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: `allow me</p> <p>to introduce it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:</p> <p>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me</p> <p>like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. `I've read that in</p> <p>some book, but I don't remember where.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and</p> <p>he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear! I</p> <p>wish you would have this cat removed!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great</p> <p>or small. `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking</p> <p>round.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and</p> <p>he hurried off.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game</p> <p>was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,</p> <p>screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three</p> <p>of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and</p> <p>she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in</p> <p>such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or</p> <p>not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p> <p></p> <p> The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,</p> <p>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one</p> <p>of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her</p> <p>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where</p> <p>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up</p> <p>into a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,</p> <p>the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:</p> <p>`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches</p> <p>are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away</p> <p>under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for</p> <p>a little more conversation with her friend.</p> <p></p> <p> When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to</p> <p>find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute</p> <p>going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who</p> <p>were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,</p> <p>and looked very uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to</p> <p>settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,</p> <p>though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed</p> <p>to make out exactly what they said.</p> <p></p> <p> The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a</p> <p>head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had</p> <p>never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin</p> <p>at HIS time of life.</p> <p></p> <p> The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be</p> <p>beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about</p> <p>it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.</p> <p>(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so</p> <p>grave and anxious.)</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the</p> <p>Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: `fetch</p> <p>her here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,</p> <p>by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely</p> <p>disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down</p> <p>looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IX</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle's Story</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old</p> <p>thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately</p> <p>into Alice's, and they walked off together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and</p> <p>thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had</p> <p>made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p> `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very</p> <p>hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT</p> <p>ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that</p> <p>makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at</p> <p>having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them</p> <p>sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar</p> <p>and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish</p> <p>people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you</p> <p>know--'</p> <p></p> <p> She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a</p> <p>little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</p> <p>`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you</p> <p>forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that</p> <p>is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. `Everything's got a</p> <p>moral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up</p> <p>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first,</p> <p>because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was</p> <p>exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,</p> <p>and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not</p> <p>like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of</p> <p>keeping up the conversation a little.</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis so,' said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--"Oh,</p> <p>'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody</p> <p>minding their own business!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,</p> <p>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,</p> <p>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the</p> <p>sounds will take care of themselves."'</p> <p></p> <p> `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your</p> <p>waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I'm</p> <p>doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the</p> <p>experiment?'</p> <p></p> <p> `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all</p> <p>anxious to have the experiment tried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very true,' said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both</p> <p>bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock</p> <p>together."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: `what a clear way you</p> <p>have of putting things!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree</p> <p>to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near</p> <p>here. And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the</p> <p>less there is of yours."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this</p> <p>last remark, `it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it</p> <p>is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of</p> <p>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put</p> <p>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than</p> <p>what it might appear to others that what you were or might have</p> <p>been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared</p> <p>to them to be otherwise."'</p> <p></p> <p> `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very</p> <p>politely, `if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it</p> <p>as you say it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess</p> <p>replied, in a pleased tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'</p> <p>said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. `I make you</p> <p>a present of everything I've said as yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. `I'm glad they don't</p> <p>give birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to</p> <p>say it out loud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her</p> <p>sharp little chin.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was</p> <p>beginning to feel a little worried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;</p> <p>and the m--'</p> <p></p> <p> But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died</p> <p>away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the</p> <p>arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up,</p> <p>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,</p> <p>frowning like a thunderstorm.</p> <p></p> <p> `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on</p> <p>the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,</p> <p>and that in about half no time! Take your choice!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p> <p></p> <p> `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice</p> <p>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her</p> <p>back to the croquet-ground.</p> <p></p> <p> The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,</p> <p>and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her,</p> <p>they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a</p> <p>moment's delay would cost them their lives.</p> <p></p> <p> All the time they were playing the Queen never left off</p> <p>quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his</p> <p>head!' or `Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were</p> <p>taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave</p> <p>off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour</p> <p>or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the</p> <p>King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of</p> <p>execution.</p> <p></p> <p> Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to</p> <p>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said Alice. `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his</p> <p>history,'</p> <p></p> <p> As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low</p> <p>voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.' `Come,</p> <p>THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite</p> <p>unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p> <p></p> <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the</p> <p>sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)</p> <p>`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to</p> <p>see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and</p> <p>see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,</p> <p>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like</p> <p>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would</p> <p>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage</p> <p>Queen: so she waited.</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the</p> <p>Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!'</p> <p>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the fun?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. `It's all her fancy, that: they</p> <p>never executes nobody, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went</p> <p>slowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life,</p> <p>never!'</p> <p></p> <p> They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the</p> <p>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,</p> <p>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart</p> <p>would break. She pitied him deeply. `What is his sorrow?' she</p> <p>asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the</p> <p>same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got</p> <p>no sorrow, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with</p> <p>large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to</p> <p>know your history, she do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow</p> <p>tone: `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've</p> <p>finished.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice</p> <p>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he</p> <p>doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.</p> <p></p> <p> `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was</p> <p>a real Turtle.'</p> <p></p> <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only</p> <p>by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and</p> <p>the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very</p> <p>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your</p> <p>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be</p> <p>more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more</p> <p>calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to</p> <p>school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call</p> <p>him Tortoise--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle angrily: `really you are very dull!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple</p> <p>question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and</p> <p>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At</p> <p>last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!</p> <p>Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe</p> <p>it--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak</p> <p>again. The Mock Turtle went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school</p> <p>every day--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be</p> <p>so proud as all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle in a tone of great relief. `Now at OURS they had at the</p> <p>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'</p> <p></p> <p> `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the</p> <p>bottom of the sea.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a</p> <p>sigh. `I only took the regular course.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was that?' inquired Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock</p> <p>Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--</p> <p>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. `What is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. `What! Never</p> <p>heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. `You know what to beautify is,</p> <p>I suppose?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to</p> <p>uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about</p> <p>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you</p> <p>to learn?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting</p> <p>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,</p> <p>with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old</p> <p>conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us</p> <p>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was THAT like?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: `I'm</p> <p>too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics</p> <p>master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he</p> <p>taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;</p> <p>and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a</p> <p>hurry to change the subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the</p> <p>next, and so on.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon</p> <p>remarked: `because they lessen from day to day.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a</p> <p>little before she made her next remark. `Then the eleventh day</p> <p>must have been a holiday?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a</p> <p>very decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER X</p> <p></p> <p> The Lobster Quadrille</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper</p> <p>across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for</p> <p>a minute or two sobs choked his voice. `Same as if he had a bone</p> <p>in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him</p> <p>and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered</p> <p>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--</p> <p>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'</p> <p>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,</p> <p>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful</p> <p>thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, indeed,' said Alice. `What sort of a dance is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;</p> <p>then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `--you advance twice--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: `advance twice, set to</p> <p>partners--'</p> <p></p> <p> `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the</p> <p>Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</p> <p></p> <p> `--as far out to sea as you can--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,</p> <p>capering wildly about.</p> <p></p> <p> `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the</p> <p>Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,</p> <p>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat</p> <p>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very much indeed,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the</p> <p>Gryphon. `We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall</p> <p>sing?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. `I've forgotten the words.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now</p> <p>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and</p> <p>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle</p> <p>sang this, very slowly and sadly:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>`"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.</p> <p>"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my</p> <p> tail.</p> <p>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</p> <p>They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be</p> <p>When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to</p> <p> sea!"</p> <p>But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look</p> <p> askance--</p> <p>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the</p> <p> dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p></p> <p>`"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.</p> <p>"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.</p> <p>The further off from England the nearer is to France--</p> <p>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</p> <p></p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p> dance?</p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p> dance?"'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said</p> <p>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: `and I do so</p> <p>like that curious song about the whiting!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've</p> <p>seen them, of course?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she</p> <p>checked herself hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but</p> <p>if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're</p> <p>like.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. `They have their</p> <p>tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:</p> <p>`crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails</p> <p>in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle</p> <p>yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all</p> <p>that,' he said to the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with</p> <p>the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So</p> <p>they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in</p> <p>their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting. I never knew</p> <p>so much about a whiting before.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the</p> <p>Gryphon. `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never thought about it,' said Alice. `Why?'</p> <p></p> <p> `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very</p> <p>solemnly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was thoroughly puzzled. `Does the boots and shoes!' she</p> <p>repeated in a wondering tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. `I</p> <p>mean, what makes them so shiny?'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she</p> <p>gave her answer. `They're done with blacking, I believe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep</p> <p>voice, `are done with a whiting. Now you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great</p> <p>curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather</p> <p>impatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were</p> <p>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep</p> <p>back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>said: `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came</p> <p>to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With</p> <p>what porpoise?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended</p> <p>tone. And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR</p> <p>adventures.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'</p> <p>said Alice a little timidly: `but it's no use going back to</p> <p>yesterday, because I was a different person then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an</p> <p>impatient tone: `explanations take such a dreadful time.'</p> <p></p> <p> So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when</p> <p>she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about</p> <p>it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on</p> <p>each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she</p> <p>gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly</p> <p>quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,</p> <p>FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming</p> <p>different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said</p> <p>`That's very curious.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated</p> <p>thoughtfully. `I should like to hear her try and repeat</p> <p>something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as</p> <p>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said</p> <p>the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat</p> <p>lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'</p> <p>However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so</p> <p>full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was</p> <p>saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,</p> <p> "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."</p> <p> As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose</p> <p> Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,</p> <p> And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,</p> <p> But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,</p> <p> His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]</p> <p></p> <p> `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'</p> <p>said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it</p> <p>sounds uncommon nonsense.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her</p> <p>hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. `Go on with</p> <p>the next verse.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. `How COULD</p> <p>he turn them out with his nose, you know?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was</p> <p>dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the</p> <p>subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:</p> <p>`it begins "I passed by his garden."'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would</p> <p>all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,</p> <p> How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,</p> <p> While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</p> <p> When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,</p> <p> Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:</p> <p> While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,</p> <p> And concluded the banquet--]</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far</p> <p>the most confusing thing I ever heard!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and</p> <p>Alice was only too glad to do so.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the</p> <p>Gryphon went on. `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you</p> <p>a song?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'</p> <p>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather</p> <p>offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her</p> <p>"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes</p> <p>choked with sobs, to sing this:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</p> <p> Waiting in a hot tureen!</p> <p> Who for such dainties would not stoop?</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,</p> <p> Game, or any other dish?</p> <p> Who would not give all else for two</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had</p> <p>just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'</p> <p>was heard in the distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,</p> <p>it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</p> <p></p> <p> `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon</p> <p>only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more</p> <p>faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the</p> <p>melancholy words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XI</p> <p></p> <p> Who Stole the Tarts?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when</p> <p>they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts</p> <p>of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:</p> <p>the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on</p> <p>each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,</p> <p>with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the</p> <p>other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large</p> <p>dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice</p> <p>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'</p> <p>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed</p> <p>to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about</p> <p>her, to pass away the time.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had</p> <p>read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that</p> <p>she knew the name of nearly everything there. `That's the</p> <p>judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'</p> <p></p> <p> The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown</p> <p>over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he</p> <p>did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly</p> <p>not becoming.</p> <p></p> <p> `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve</p> <p>creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because</p> <p>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they</p> <p>are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over</p> <p>to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and</p> <p>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the</p> <p>meaning of it at all. However, `jury-men' would have done just</p> <p>as well.</p> <p></p> <p> The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</p> <p>`What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. `They</p> <p>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in</p> <p>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the</p> <p>trial.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but</p> <p>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in</p> <p>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked</p> <p>anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their</p> <p>shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'</p> <p>on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them</p> <p>didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his</p> <p>neighbour to tell him. `A nice muddle their slates'll be in</p> <p>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,</p> <p>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got</p> <p>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it</p> <p>away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was</p> <p>Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of</p> <p>it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write</p> <p>with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very</p> <p>little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p> <p></p> <p> `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and</p> <p>then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--</p> <p></p> <p> `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,</p> <p> All on a summer day:</p> <p> The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,</p> <p> And took them quite away!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. `There's</p> <p>a great deal to come before that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit</p> <p>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First</p> <p>witness!'</p> <p></p> <p> The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in</p> <p>one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. `I beg</p> <p>pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in: but I</p> <p>hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to have finished,' said the King. `When did you</p> <p>begin?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into</p> <p>the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. `Fourteenth of March, I</p> <p>think it was,' he said.</p> <p></p> <p> `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury</p> <p>eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then</p> <p>added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</p> <p></p> <p> `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who</p> <p>instantly made a memorandum of the fact.</p> <p></p> <p> `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;</p> <p>`I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'</p> <p></p> <p> Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or</p> <p>I'll have you executed on the spot.'</p> <p></p> <p> This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept</p> <p>shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the</p> <p>Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his</p> <p>teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.</p> <p></p> <p> Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which</p> <p>puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was</p> <p>beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she</p> <p>would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she</p> <p>decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for</p> <p>her.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was</p> <p>sitting next to her. `I can hardly breathe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: `I'm growing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: `you know</p> <p>you're growing too.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:</p> <p>`not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily</p> <p>and crossed over to the other side of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to</p> <p>one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the</p> <p>singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter</p> <p>trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have</p> <p>you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a</p> <p>trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week</p> <p>or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and</p> <p>the twinkling of the tea--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.</p> <p>`Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things</p> <p>twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did!' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `I deny it!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `He denies it,' said the King: `leave out that part.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,</p> <p>looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the</p> <p>Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</p> <p></p> <p> `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-</p> <p>and-butter--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you</p> <p>executed.'</p> <p></p> <p> The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,</p> <p>and went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he</p> <p>began.</p> <p></p> <p> `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately</p> <p>suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a</p> <p>hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had</p> <p>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:</p> <p>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat</p> <p>upon it.)</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've so often</p> <p>read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some</p> <p>attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the</p> <p>officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant</p> <p>till now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'</p> <p>continued the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as</p> <p>it is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.</p> <p></p> <p> Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. `Now we</p> <p>shall get on better.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious</p> <p>look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</p> <p></p> <p> `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the</p> <p>court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.</p> <p></p> <p> `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one</p> <p>of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the</p> <p>officer could get to the door.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the next witness!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the</p> <p>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before</p> <p>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began</p> <p>sneezing all at once.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shan't,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a</p> <p>low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy</p> <p>air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till</p> <p>his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What</p> <p>are tarts made of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead that</p> <p>Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch</p> <p>him! Off with his whiskers!'</p> <p></p> <p> For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the</p> <p>Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down</p> <p>again, the cook had disappeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.</p> <p>`Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the</p> <p>Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.</p> <p>It quite makes my forehead ache!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,</p> <p>feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,</p> <p>`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.</p> <p>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top</p> <p>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XII</p> <p></p> <p> Alice's Evidence</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the</p> <p>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she</p> <p>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with</p> <p>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads</p> <p>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding</p> <p>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset</p> <p>the week before.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great</p> <p>dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,</p> <p>for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and</p> <p>she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once</p> <p>and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</p> <p></p> <p> `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave</p> <p>voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--</p> <p>ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as</p> <p>he said do.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she</p> <p>had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing</p> <p>was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable</p> <p>to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that</p> <p>it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it</p> <p>would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of</p> <p>being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and</p> <p>handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write</p> <p>out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed</p> <p>too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,</p> <p>gazing up into the roof of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you know about this business?' the King said to</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.</p> <p>They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when</p> <p>the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,</p> <p>of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and</p> <p>making faces at him as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and</p> <p>went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--</p> <p>unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word</p> <p>sounded best.</p> <p></p> <p> Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some</p> <p>`unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to</p> <p>look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she</p> <p>thought to herself.</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily</p> <p>writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out</p> <p>from his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE</p> <p>HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'</p> <p></p> <p> Everybody looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You are,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides,</p> <p>that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</p> <p>`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said</p> <p>the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has</p> <p>just been picked up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What's in it?' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems</p> <p>to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was</p> <p>written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,</p> <p>there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper</p> <p>as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set</p> <p>of verses.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of</p> <p>the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the</p> <p>queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)</p> <p></p> <p> `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.</p> <p>(The jury all brightened up again.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and</p> <p>they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the</p> <p>matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd</p> <p>have signed your name like an honest man.'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the</p> <p>first really clever thing the King had said that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't</p> <p>even know what they're about!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Read them,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,</p> <p>please your Majesty?' he asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on</p> <p>till you come to the end: then stop.'</p> <p></p> <p> These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--</p> <p></p> <p> `They told me you had been to her,</p> <p> And mentioned me to him:</p> <p> She gave me a good character,</p> <p> But said I could not swim.</p> <p></p> <p> He sent them word I had not gone</p> <p> (We know it to be true):</p> <p> If she should push the matter on,</p> <p> What would become of you?</p> <p></p> <p> I gave her one, they gave him two,</p> <p> You gave us three or more;</p> <p> They all returned from him to you,</p> <p> Though they were mine before.</p> <p></p> <p> If I or she should chance to be</p> <p> Involved in this affair,</p> <p> He trusts to you to set them free,</p> <p> Exactly as we were.</p> <p></p> <p> My notion was that you had been</p> <p> (Before she had this fit)</p> <p> An obstacle that came between</p> <p> Him, and ourselves, and it.</p> <p></p> <p> Don't let him know she liked them best,</p> <p> For this must ever be</p> <p> A secret, kept from all the rest,</p> <p> Between yourself and me.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'</p> <p>said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'</p> <p></p> <p> `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had</p> <p>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit</p> <p>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't</p> <p>believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'</p> <p></p> <p> The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe</p> <p>there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to</p> <p>explain the paper.</p> <p></p> <p> `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a</p> <p>world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And</p> <p>yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his</p> <p>knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some</p> <p>meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you</p> <p>can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.</p> <p>(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)</p> <p></p> <p> `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering</p> <p>over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's</p> <p>the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,</p> <p>that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to</p> <p>the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.</p> <p>Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my</p> <p>dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the</p> <p>Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off</p> <p>writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no</p> <p>mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was</p> <p>trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round</p> <p>the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and</p> <p>everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the</p> <p>King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having</p> <p>the sentence first!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't!' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</p> <p>Nobody moved.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full</p> <p>size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'</p> <p></p> <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying</p> <p>down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half</p> <p>of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on</p> <p>the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently</p> <p>brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the</p> <p>trees upon her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long</p> <p>sleep you've had!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told</p> <p>her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange</p> <p>Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and</p> <p>when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a</p> <p>curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's</p> <p>getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she</p> <p>ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</p> <p></p> <p> But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her</p> <p>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of</p> <p>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began</p> <p>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--</p> <p></p> <p> First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the</p> <p>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes</p> <p>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her</p> <p>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back</p> <p>the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and</p> <p>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place</p> <p>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little</p> <p>sister's dream.</p> <p></p> <p> The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried</p> <p>by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the</p> <p>neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as</p> <p>the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,</p> <p>and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate</p> <p>guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the</p> <p>Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once</p> <p>more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's</p> <p>slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,</p> <p>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable</p> <p>Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in</p> <p>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and</p> <p>all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only</p> <p>rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the</p> <p>reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-</p> <p>bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd</p> <p>boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and</p> <p>all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the</p> <p>confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the</p> <p>cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's</p> <p>heavy sobs.</p> <p></p> <p> Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of</p> <p>hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how</p> <p>she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and</p> <p>loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about</p> <p>her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager</p> <p>with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of</p> <p>Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their</p> <p>simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,</p> <p>remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</p> <p></p> <p> THE END</p>
ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND</p> <p></p> <p> Lewis Carroll</p> <p></p> <p> THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER I</p> <p></p> <p> Down the Rabbit-Hole</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister</p> <p>on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had</p> <p>peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no</p> <p>pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'</p> <p>thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'</p> <p></p> <p> So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,</p> <p>for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether</p> <p>the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble</p> <p>of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White</p> <p>Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p> <p></p> <p> There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice</p> <p>think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to</p> <p>itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought</p> <p>it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have</p> <p>wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);</p> <p>but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-</p> <p>POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to</p> <p>her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never</p> <p>before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to</p> <p>take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the</p> <p>field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop</p> <p>down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</p> <p></p> <p> In another moment down went Alice after it, never once</p> <p>considering how in the world she was to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,</p> <p>and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a</p> <p>moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself</p> <p>falling down a very deep well.</p> <p></p> <p> Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she</p> <p>had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to</p> <p>wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look</p> <p>down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to</p> <p>see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and</p> <p>noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;</p> <p>here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She</p> <p>took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was</p> <p>labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it</p> <p>was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing</p> <p>somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she</p> <p>fell past it.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I</p> <p>shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll</p> <p>all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,</p> <p>even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely</p> <p>true.)</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! `I</p> <p>wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.</p> <p>`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let</p> <p>me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,</p> <p>you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her</p> <p>lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good</p> <p>opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to</p> <p>listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,</p> <p>that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude</p> <p>or Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,</p> <p>or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to</p> <p>say.)</p> <p></p> <p> Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right</p> <p>THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the</p> <p>people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I</p> <p>think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this</p> <p>time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall</p> <p>have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.</p> <p>Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried</p> <p>to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling</p> <p>through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what</p> <p>an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll</p> <p>never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'</p> <p></p> <p> Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon</p> <p>began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I</p> <p>should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember</p> <p>her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were</p> <p>down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but</p> <p>you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.</p> <p>But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get</p> <p>rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of</p> <p>way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do</p> <p>bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either</p> <p>question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt</p> <p>that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she</p> <p>was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very</p> <p>earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a</p> <p>bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of</p> <p>sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a</p> <p>moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her</p> <p>was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in</p> <p>sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost:</p> <p>away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it</p> <p>say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late</p> <p>it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the</p> <p>corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found</p> <p>herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps</p> <p>hanging from the roof.</p> <p></p> <p> There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;</p> <p>and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the</p> <p>other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,</p> <p>wondering how she was ever to get out again.</p> <p></p> <p> Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of</p> <p>solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,</p> <p>and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the</p> <p>doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or</p> <p>the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of</p> <p>them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low</p> <p>curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little</p> <p>door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key</p> <p>in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!</p> <p></p> <p> Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small</p> <p>passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and</p> <p>looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.</p> <p>How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about</p> <p>among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but</p> <p>she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if</p> <p>my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of</p> <p>very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish</p> <p>I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only</p> <p>know how to begin.' For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things</p> <p>had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few</p> <p>things indeed were really impossible.</p> <p></p> <p> There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she</p> <p>went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on</p> <p>it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like</p> <p>telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which</p> <p>certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck</p> <p>of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'</p> <p>beautifully printed on it in large letters.</p> <p></p> <p> It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little</p> <p>Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. `No, I'll look</p> <p>first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';</p> <p>for she had read several nice little histories about children who</p> <p>had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant</p> <p>things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules</p> <p>their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker</p> <p>will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your</p> <p>finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had</p> <p>never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked</p> <p>`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or</p> <p>later.</p> <p></p> <p> However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured</p> <p>to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort</p> <p>of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast</p> <p>turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished</p> <p>it off.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up</p> <p>like a telescope.'</p> <p></p> <p> And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and</p> <p>her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right</p> <p>size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.</p> <p>First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was</p> <p>going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about</p> <p>this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my</p> <p>going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be</p> <p>like then?' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is</p> <p>like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember</p> <p>ever having seen such a thing.</p> <p></p> <p> After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided</p> <p>on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!</p> <p>when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the</p> <p>little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,</p> <p>she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it</p> <p>quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb</p> <p>up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;</p> <p>and when she had tired herself out with trying,</p> <p>the poor little thing sat down and cried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to</p> <p>herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'</p> <p>She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very</p> <p>seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so</p> <p>severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered</p> <p>trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game</p> <p>of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious</p> <p>child was very fond of pretending to be two people. `But it's no</p> <p>use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! Why,</p> <p>there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable</p> <p>person!'</p> <p></p> <p> Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under</p> <p>the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on</p> <p>which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.</p> <p>`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,</p> <p>I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep</p> <p>under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I</p> <p>don't care which happens!'</p> <p></p> <p> She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which</p> <p>way? Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to</p> <p>feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to</p> <p>find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally</p> <p>happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the</p> <p>way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,</p> <p>that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the</p> <p>common way.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER II</p> <p></p> <p> The Pool of Tears</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much</p> <p>surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good</p> <p>English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that</p> <p>ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her</p> <p>feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so</p> <p>far off). `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on</p> <p>your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I'm sure _I_ shan't</p> <p>be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself</p> <p>about you: you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be</p> <p>kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the</p> <p>way I want to go! Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of</p> <p>boots every Christmas.'</p> <p></p> <p> And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.</p> <p>`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll</p> <p>seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the</p> <p>directions will look!</p> <p></p> <p> ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.</p> <p> HEARTHRUG,</p> <p> NEAR THE FENDER,</p> <p> (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).</p> <p></p> <p>Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in</p> <p>fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took</p> <p>up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.</p> <p></p> <p> Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one</p> <p>side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get</p> <p>through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to</p> <p>cry again.</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great</p> <p>girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in</p> <p>this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!' But she went on all</p> <p>the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool</p> <p>all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the</p> <p>hall.</p> <p></p> <p> After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the</p> <p>distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.</p> <p>It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a</p> <p>pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the</p> <p>other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to</p> <p>himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she</p> <p>be savage if I've kept her waiting!' Alice felt so desperate</p> <p>that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit</p> <p>came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,</p> <p>sir--' The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid</p> <p>gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard</p> <p>as he could go.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very</p> <p>hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:</p> <p>`Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday</p> <p>things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in</p> <p>the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this</p> <p>morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little</p> <p>different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in</p> <p>the world am I? Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!' And she began</p> <p>thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age</p> <p>as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of</p> <p>them.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such</p> <p>long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm</p> <p>sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,</p> <p>oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,</p> <p>and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the</p> <p>things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,</p> <p>and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!</p> <p>I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the</p> <p>Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography.</p> <p>London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,</p> <p>and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been</p> <p>changed for Mabel! I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'</p> <p>and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,</p> <p>and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and</p> <p>strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--</p> <p></p> <p> `How doth the little crocodile</p> <p> Improve his shining tail,</p> <p> And pour the waters of the Nile</p> <p> On every golden scale!</p> <p></p> <p> `How cheerfully he seems to grin,</p> <p> How neatly spread his claws,</p> <p> And welcome little fishes in</p> <p> With gently smiling jaws!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and</p> <p>her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel</p> <p>after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little</p> <p>house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so</p> <p>many lessons to learn! No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm</p> <p>Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their</p> <p>heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!" I shall only look</p> <p>up and say "Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I</p> <p>like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down</p> <p>here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a</p> <p>sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads</p> <p>down! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was</p> <p>surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little</p> <p>white kid gloves while she was talking. `How CAN I have done</p> <p>that?' she thought. `I must be growing small again.' She got up</p> <p>and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,</p> <p>as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,</p> <p>and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the</p> <p>cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it</p> <p>hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.</p> <p></p> <p>`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at</p> <p>the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in</p> <p>existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed</p> <p>back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut</p> <p>again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as</p> <p>before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,</p> <p>`for I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare</p> <p>it's too bad, that it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another</p> <p>moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first</p> <p>idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that</p> <p>case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself. (Alice had</p> <p>been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general</p> <p>conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find</p> <p>a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in</p> <p>the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and</p> <p>behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that</p> <p>she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine</p> <p>feet high.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,</p> <p>trying to find her way out. `I shall be punished for it now, I</p> <p>suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer</p> <p>thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'</p> <p></p> <p> Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a</p> <p>little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at</p> <p>first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then</p> <p>she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that</p> <p>it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this</p> <p>mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should</p> <p>think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in</p> <p>trying.' So she began: `O Mouse, do you know the way out of</p> <p>this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'</p> <p>(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:</p> <p>she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having</p> <p>seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a</p> <p>mouse--a mouse--O mouse!') The Mouse looked at her rather</p> <p>inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little</p> <p>eyes, but it said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I</p> <p>daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the</p> <p>Conqueror.' (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had</p> <p>no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she</p> <p>began again: `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in</p> <p>her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the</p> <p>water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. `Oh, I beg</p> <p>your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the</p> <p>poor animal's feelings. `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate</p> <p>voice. `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone: `don't be</p> <p>angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:</p> <p>I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.</p> <p>She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,</p> <p>as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so</p> <p>nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and</p> <p>she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital</p> <p>one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,</p> <p>for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt</p> <p>certain it must be really offended. `We won't talk about her any</p> <p>more if you'd rather not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end</p> <p>of his tail. `As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family</p> <p>always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear</p> <p>the name again!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the</p> <p>subject of conversation. `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'</p> <p>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: `There is</p> <p>such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!</p> <p>A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly</p> <p>brown hair! And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and</p> <p>it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I</p> <p>can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you</p> <p>know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!</p> <p>He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!' For the</p> <p>Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and</p> <p>making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.</p> <p></p> <p> So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear! Do come back</p> <p>again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't</p> <p>like them!' When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam</p> <p>slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice</p> <p>thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to</p> <p>the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll</p> <p>understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded</p> <p>with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a</p> <p>Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious</p> <p>creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the</p> <p>shore.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER III</p> <p></p> <p> A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the</p> <p>bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their</p> <p>fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and</p> <p>uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they</p> <p>had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed</p> <p>quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with</p> <p>them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had</p> <p>quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,</p> <p>and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';</p> <p>and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,</p> <p>and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no</p> <p>more to be said.</p> <p></p> <p> At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among</p> <p>them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I'LL</p> <p>soon make you dry enough!' They all sat down at once, in a large</p> <p>ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes</p> <p>anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad</p> <p>cold if she did not get dry very soon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?</p> <p>This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!</p> <p>"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was</p> <p>soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been</p> <p>of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very</p> <p>politely: `Did you speak?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought you did,' said the Mouse. `--I proceed. "Edwin and</p> <p>Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:</p> <p>and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found</p> <p>it advisable--"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.</p> <p></p> <p> `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly: `of course you</p> <p>know what "it" means.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said</p> <p>the Duck: `it's generally a frog or a worm. The question is,</p> <p>what did the archbishop find?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,</p> <p>`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William</p> <p>and offer him the crown. William's conduct at first was</p> <p>moderate. But the insolence of his Normans--" How are you</p> <p>getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it</p> <p>spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone: `it doesn't</p> <p>seem to dry me at all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I</p> <p>move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more</p> <p>energetic remedies--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak English!' said the Eaglet. `I don't know the meaning of</p> <p>half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do</p> <p>either!' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:</p> <p>some of the other birds tittered audibly.</p> <p></p> <p> `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,</p> <p>`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much</p> <p>to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY</p> <p>ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'</p> <p>(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter</p> <p>day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)</p> <p></p> <p> First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the</p> <p>exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party</p> <p>were placed along the course, here and there. There was no `One,</p> <p>two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,</p> <p>and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know</p> <p>when the race was over. However, when they had been running half</p> <p>an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called</p> <p>out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,</p> <p>and asking, `But who has won?'</p> <p></p> <p> This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of</p> <p>thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon</p> <p>its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,</p> <p>in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At</p> <p>last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have</p> <p>prizes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices</p> <p>asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with</p> <p>one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,</p> <p>calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand</p> <p>in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt</p> <p>water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.</p> <p>There was exactly one a-piece all round.</p> <p></p> <p> `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely. `What else have</p> <p>you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.</p> <p></p> <p> Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo</p> <p>solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of</p> <p>this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short</p> <p>speech, they all cheered.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked</p> <p>so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not</p> <p>think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,</p> <p>looking as solemn as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise</p> <p>and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not</p> <p>taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on</p> <p>the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again</p> <p>in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.</p> <p></p> <p> `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,</p> <p>`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half</p> <p>afraid that it would be offended again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to</p> <p>Alice, and sighing.</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with</p> <p>wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?' And</p> <p>she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so</p> <p>that her idea of the tale was something like this:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Fury said to a</p> <p> mouse, That he</p> <p> met in the</p> <p> house,</p> <p> "Let us</p> <p> both go to</p> <p> law: I will</p> <p> prosecute</p> <p> YOU. --Come,</p> <p> I'll take no</p> <p> denial; We</p> <p> must have a</p> <p> trial: For</p> <p> really this</p> <p> morning I've</p> <p> nothing</p> <p> to do."</p> <p> Said the</p> <p> mouse to the</p> <p> cur, "Such</p> <p> a trial,</p> <p> dear Sir,</p> <p> With</p> <p> no jury</p> <p> or judge,</p> <p> would be</p> <p> wasting</p> <p> our</p> <p> breath."</p> <p> "I'll be</p> <p> judge, I'll</p> <p> be jury,"</p> <p> Said</p> <p> cunning</p> <p> old Fury:</p> <p> "I'll</p> <p> try the</p> <p> whole</p> <p> cause,</p> <p> and</p> <p> condemn</p> <p> you</p> <p> to</p> <p> death."'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.</p> <p>`What are you thinking of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly: `you had got to</p> <p>the fifth bend, I think?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about her. `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up</p> <p>and walking away. `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice. `But you're so easily</p> <p>offended, you know!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mouse only growled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after</p> <p>it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but</p> <p>the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little</p> <p>quicker.</p> <p></p> <p> `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it</p> <p>was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of</p> <p>saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you</p> <p>never to lose YOUR temper!' `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the</p> <p>young Crab, a little snappishly. `You're enough to try the</p> <p>patience of an oyster!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,</p> <p>addressing nobody in particular. `She'd soon fetch it back!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'</p> <p>said the Lory.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about</p> <p>her pet: `Dinah's our cat. And she's such a capital one for</p> <p>catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her</p> <p>after the birds! Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look</p> <p>at it!'</p> <p></p> <p> This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.</p> <p>Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began</p> <p>wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be</p> <p>getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary</p> <p>called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my</p> <p>dears! It's high time you were all in bed!' On various pretexts</p> <p>they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a</p> <p>melancholy tone. `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm</p> <p>sure she's the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I</p> <p>wonder if I shall ever see you any more!' And here poor Alice</p> <p>began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.</p> <p>In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of</p> <p>footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping</p> <p>that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to</p> <p>finish his story.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IV</p> <p></p> <p> The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and</p> <p>looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;</p> <p>and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess! The Duchess!</p> <p>Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She'll get me</p> <p>executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have</p> <p>dropped them, I wonder?' Alice guessed in a moment that it was</p> <p>looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she</p> <p>very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were</p> <p>nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her</p> <p>swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and</p> <p>the little door, had vanished completely.</p> <p></p> <p> Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,</p> <p>and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE</p> <p>you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of</p> <p>gloves and a fan! Quick, now!' And Alice was so much frightened</p> <p>that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without</p> <p>trying to explain the mistake it had made.</p> <p></p> <p> `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.</p> <p>`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am! But I'd</p> <p>better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'</p> <p>As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door</p> <p>of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'</p> <p>engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried</p> <p>upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,</p> <p>and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and</p> <p>gloves.</p> <p></p> <p> `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going</p> <p>messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on</p> <p>messages next!' And she began fancying the sort of thing that</p> <p>would happen: `"Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready</p> <p>for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see</p> <p>that the mouse doesn't get out." Only I don't think,' Alice went</p> <p>on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering</p> <p>people about like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with</p> <p>a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two</p> <p>or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and</p> <p>a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when</p> <p>her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-</p> <p>glass. There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'</p> <p>but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. `I know</p> <p>SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,</p> <p>`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this</p> <p>bottle does. I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for</p> <p>really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'</p> <p></p> <p> It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:</p> <p>before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing</p> <p>against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being</p> <p>broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself</p> <p>`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I</p> <p>can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so</p> <p>much!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and</p> <p>growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in</p> <p>another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried</p> <p>the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the</p> <p>other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,</p> <p>as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one</p> <p>foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,</p> <p>whatever happens. What WILL become of me?'</p> <p></p> <p> Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full</p> <p>effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable,</p> <p>and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting</p> <p>out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one</p> <p>wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about</p> <p>by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn't gone down that</p> <p>rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,</p> <p>this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!</p> <p>When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing</p> <p>never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There</p> <p>ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when</p> <p>I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a</p> <p>sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more</p> <p>HERE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I</p> <p>am now? That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--</p> <p>but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself. `How can you</p> <p>learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no</p> <p>room at all for any lesson-books!'</p> <p></p> <p> And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,</p> <p>and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few</p> <p>minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Mary Ann! Mary Ann!' said the voice. `Fetch me my gloves</p> <p>this moment!' Then came a little pattering of feet on the</p> <p>stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and</p> <p>she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she</p> <p>was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no</p> <p>reason to be afraid of it.</p> <p></p> <p> Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;</p> <p>but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed</p> <p>hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it</p> <p>say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she</p> <p>fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly</p> <p>spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not</p> <p>get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,</p> <p>and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was</p> <p>just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something</p> <p>of the sort.</p> <p></p> <p> Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are</p> <p>you?' And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then</p> <p>I'm here! Digging for apples, yer honour!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily. `Here!</p> <p>Come and help me out of THIS!' (Sounds of more broken glass.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!' (He pronounced it `arrum.')</p> <p></p> <p> `An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it</p> <p>fills the whole window!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it</p> <p>away!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear</p> <p>whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer</p> <p>honour, at all, at all!' `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at</p> <p>last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in</p> <p>the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more</p> <p>sounds of broken glass. `What a number of cucumber-frames there</p> <p>must be!' thought Alice. `I wonder what they'll do next! As for</p> <p>pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I</p> <p>don't want to stay in here any longer!'</p> <p></p> <p> She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at</p> <p>last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a</p> <p>good many voices all talking together: she made out the words:</p> <p>`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;</p> <p>Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up</p> <p>at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half</p> <p>high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--</p> <p>Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind</p> <p>that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!' (a loud</p> <p>crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go</p> <p>down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,</p> <p>then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to</p> <p>go down the chimney!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said</p> <p>Alice to herself. `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!</p> <p>I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is</p> <p>narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'</p> <p></p> <p> She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and</p> <p>waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what</p> <p>sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close</p> <p>above her: then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one</p> <p>sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes</p> <p>Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the</p> <p>hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold</p> <p>up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?</p> <p>What happened to you? Tell us all about it!'</p> <p></p> <p> Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'</p> <p>thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm</p> <p>better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know</p> <p>is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes</p> <p>like a sky-rocket!'</p> <p></p> <p> `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and</p> <p>Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do. I'll set</p> <p>Dinah at you!'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to</p> <p>herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any</p> <p>sense, they'd take the roof off.' After a minute or two, they</p> <p>began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A</p> <p>barrowful will do, to begin with.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to</p> <p>doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came</p> <p>rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.</p> <p>`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,</p> <p>`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead</p> <p>silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all</p> <p>turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright</p> <p>idea came into her head. `If I eat one of these cakes,' she</p> <p>thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it</p> <p>can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I</p> <p>suppose.'</p> <p></p> <p> So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find</p> <p>that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small</p> <p>enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and</p> <p>found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.</p> <p>The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by</p> <p>two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.</p> <p>They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she</p> <p>ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a</p> <p>thick wood.</p> <p></p> <p> `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she</p> <p>wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;</p> <p>and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.</p> <p>I think that will be the best plan.'</p> <p></p> <p> It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and</p> <p>simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the</p> <p>smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering</p> <p>about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over</p> <p>her head made her look up in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round</p> <p>eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.</p> <p>`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried</p> <p>hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the</p> <p>time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it</p> <p>would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.</p> <p></p> <p> Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of</p> <p>stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped</p> <p>into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,</p> <p>and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice</p> <p>dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run</p> <p>over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy</p> <p>made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in</p> <p>its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very</p> <p>like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every</p> <p>moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle</p> <p>again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the</p> <p>stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long</p> <p>way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat</p> <p>down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its</p> <p>mouth, and its great eyes half shut.</p> <p></p> <p> This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;</p> <p>so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out</p> <p>of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the</p> <p>distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she</p> <p>leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself</p> <p>with one of the leaves: `I should have liked teaching it tricks</p> <p>very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it! Oh</p> <p>dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again! Let</p> <p>me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or</p> <p>drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'</p> <p></p> <p> The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round</p> <p>her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see</p> <p>anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under</p> <p>the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her,</p> <p>about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under</p> <p>it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her</p> <p>that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.</p> <p></p> <p> She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of</p> <p>the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large</p> <p>caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,</p> <p>quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice</p> <p>of her or of anything else.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER V</p> <p></p> <p> Advice from a Caterpillar</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in</p> <p>silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice</p> <p>replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--</p> <p>at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think</p> <p>I must have been changed several times since then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.</p> <p>`Explain yourself!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because</p> <p>I'm not myself, you see.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very</p> <p>politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and</p> <p>being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but</p> <p>when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you</p> <p>know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll</p> <p>feel it a little queer, won't you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;</p> <p>`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously. `Who are YOU?'</p> <p></p> <p> Which brought them back again to the beginning of the</p> <p>conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's</p> <p>making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,</p> <p>very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not</p> <p>think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in</p> <p>a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. `I've something</p> <p>important to say!'</p> <p></p> <p> This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as</p> <p>she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else</p> <p>to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth</p> <p>hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but</p> <p>at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth</p> <p>again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as</p> <p>I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it</p> <p>all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice folded her hands, and began:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,</p> <p> `And your hair has become very white;</p> <p> And yet you incessantly stand on your head--</p> <p> Do you think, at your age, it is right?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,</p> <p> `I feared it might injure the brain;</p> <p> But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,</p> <p> Why, I do it again and again.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,</p> <p> And have grown most uncommonly fat;</p> <p> Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--</p> <p> Pray, what is the reason of that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,</p> <p> `I kept all my limbs very supple</p> <p> By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--</p> <p> Allow me to sell you a couple?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak</p> <p> For anything tougher than suet;</p> <p> Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--</p> <p> Pray how did you manage to do it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,</p> <p> And argued each case with my wife;</p> <p> And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,</p> <p> Has lasted the rest of my life.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose</p> <p> That your eye was as steady as ever;</p> <p> Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--</p> <p> What made you so awfully clever?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'</p> <p> Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!</p> <p> Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?</p> <p> Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the</p> <p>words have got altered.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.</p> <p></p> <p> The Caterpillar was the first to speak.</p> <p></p> <p> `What size do you want to be?' it asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;</p> <p>`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in</p> <p>her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you</p> <p>wouldn't mind,' said Alice: `three inches is such a wretched</p> <p>height to be.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar</p> <p>angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three</p> <p>inches high).</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.</p> <p>And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so</p> <p>easily offended!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it</p> <p>put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.</p> <p></p> <p> This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.</p> <p>In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its</p> <p>mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got</p> <p>down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely</p> <p>remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and</p> <p>the other side will make you grow shorter.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had</p> <p>asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a</p> <p>minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as</p> <p>it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.</p> <p>However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they</p> <p>would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</p> <p></p> <p> `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a</p> <p>little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment</p> <p>she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her</p> <p>foot!</p> <p></p> <p> She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but</p> <p>she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking</p> <p>rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.</p> <p>Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was</p> <p>hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and</p> <p>managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples create.sh index.html rea-ihc site-simples *</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of</p> <p>delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she</p> <p>found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could</p> <p>see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which</p> <p>seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay</p> <p>far below her.</p> <p></p> <p> `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. `And where</p> <p>HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I</p> <p>can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no</p> <p>result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the</p> <p>distant green leaves.</p> <p></p> <p> As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her</p> <p>head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted</p> <p>to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,</p> <p>like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a</p> <p>graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which</p> <p>she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she</p> <p>had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a</p> <p>hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating</p> <p>her violently with its wings.</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly. `Let me alone!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more</p> <p>subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every</p> <p>way, and nothing seems to suit them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've</p> <p>tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but</p> <p>those serpents! There's no pleasing them!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no</p> <p>use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.</p> <p></p> <p> `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the</p> <p>Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and</p> <p>day! Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was</p> <p>beginning to see its meaning.</p> <p></p> <p> `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued</p> <p>the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was</p> <p>thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come</p> <p>wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice. `I'm a--I'm</p> <p>a--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon. `I can see you're</p> <p>trying to invent something!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she</p> <p>remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the</p> <p>deepest contempt. `I've seen a good many little girls in my</p> <p>time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a</p> <p>serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be</p> <p>telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very</p> <p>truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as</p> <p>serpents do, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why</p> <p>then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent</p> <p>for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of</p> <p>adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and</p> <p>what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a</p> <p>serpent?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm</p> <p>not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't</p> <p>want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it</p> <p>settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the</p> <p>trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled</p> <p>among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and</p> <p>untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the</p> <p>pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very</p> <p>carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and</p> <p>growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had</p> <p>succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</p> <p></p> <p> It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,</p> <p>that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a</p> <p>few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. `Come,</p> <p>there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes</p> <p>are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to</p> <p>another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next</p> <p>thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be</p> <p>done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an</p> <p>open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.</p> <p>`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come</p> <p>upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their</p> <p>wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did</p> <p>not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself</p> <p>down to nine inches high.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VI</p> <p></p> <p> Pig and Pepper</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and</p> <p>wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came</p> <p>running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman</p> <p>because he was in livery: otherwise, judging by his face only,</p> <p>she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door</p> <p>with his knuckles. It was opened by another footman in livery,</p> <p>with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,</p> <p>Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their</p> <p>heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and</p> <p>crept a little way out of the wood to listen.</p> <p></p> <p> The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great</p> <p>letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to</p> <p>the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess. An</p> <p>invitation from the Queen to play croquet.' The Frog-Footman</p> <p>repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the</p> <p>words a little, `From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess</p> <p>to play croquet.'</p> <p></p> <p> Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled</p> <p>together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into</p> <p>the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped</p> <p>out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the</p> <p>ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and</p> <p>that for two reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the</p> <p>door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise</p> <p>inside, no one could possibly hear you.' And certainly there was</p> <p>a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling</p> <p>and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish</p> <p>or kettle had been broken to pieces.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'</p> <p></p> <p> `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went</p> <p>on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us. For</p> <p>instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let</p> <p>you out, you know.' He was looking up into the sky all the time</p> <p>he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. `But</p> <p>perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so</p> <p>VERY nearly at the top of his head. But at any rate he might</p> <p>answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate</p> <p>came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just</p> <p>grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees</p> <p>behind him.</p> <p></p> <p> `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,</p> <p>exactly as if nothing had happened.</p> <p></p> <p> `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman. `That's the</p> <p>first question, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so.</p> <p>`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the</p> <p>creatures argue. It's enough to drive one crazy!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for</p> <p>repeating his remark, with variations. `I shall sit here,' he</p> <p>said, `on and off, for days and days.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what am I to do?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:</p> <p>`he's perfectly idiotic!' And she opened the door and went in.</p> <p></p> <p> The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of</p> <p>smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a</p> <p>three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was</p> <p>leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to</p> <p>be full of soup.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to</p> <p>herself, as well as she could for sneezing.</p> <p></p> <p> There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the</p> <p>Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was</p> <p>sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause. The</p> <p>only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,</p> <p>and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from</p> <p>ear to ear.</p> <p></p> <p> `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for</p> <p>she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to</p> <p>speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why. Pig!'</p> <p></p> <p> She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice</p> <p>quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed</p> <p>to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I</p> <p>didn't know that cats COULD grin.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,</p> <p>feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.</p> <p></p> <p> `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought</p> <p>it would be as well to introduce some other subject of</p> <p>conversation. While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took</p> <p>the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work</p> <p>throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby</p> <p>--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,</p> <p>plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of them even when</p> <p>they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it</p> <p>was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up</p> <p>and down in an agony of terror. `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS</p> <p>nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very</p> <p>nearly carried it off.</p> <p></p> <p> `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a</p> <p>hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it</p> <p>does.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very</p> <p>glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her</p> <p>knowledge. `Just think of what work it would make with the day</p> <p>and night! You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn</p> <p>round on its axis--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant</p> <p>to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and</p> <p>seemed not to be listening, so she went on again: `Twenty-four</p> <p>hours, I THINK; or is it twelve? I--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide</p> <p>figures!' And with that she began nursing her child again,</p> <p>singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a</p> <p>violent shake at the end of every line:</p> <p></p> <p> `Speak roughly to your little boy,</p> <p> And beat him when he sneezes:</p> <p> He only does it to annoy,</p> <p> Because he knows it teases.'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> (In which the cook and the baby joined):--</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept</p> <p>tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing</p> <p>howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I speak severely to my boy,</p> <p> I beat him when he sneezes;</p> <p> For he can thoroughly enjoy</p> <p> The pepper when he pleases!'</p> <p></p> <p> CHORUS.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wow! wow! wow!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said</p> <p>to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. `I must go and</p> <p>get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of</p> <p>the room. The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,</p> <p>but it just missed her.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-</p> <p>shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all</p> <p>directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice. The poor</p> <p>little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,</p> <p>and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,</p> <p>so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much</p> <p>as she could do to hold it.</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,</p> <p>(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep</p> <p>tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its</p> <p>undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air. `IF I</p> <p>don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure</p> <p>to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it</p> <p>behind?' She said the last words out loud, and the little thing</p> <p>grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time). `Don't</p> <p>grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing</p> <p>yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into</p> <p>its face to see what was the matter with it. There could be no</p> <p>doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout</p> <p>than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for</p> <p>a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at</p> <p>all. `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked</p> <p>into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.</p> <p></p> <p> No, there were no tears. `If you're going to turn into a pig,</p> <p>my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do</p> <p>with you. Mind now!' The poor little thing sobbed again (or</p> <p>grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for</p> <p>some while in silence.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I</p> <p>to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted</p> <p>again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some</p> <p>alarm. This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was</p> <p>neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be</p> <p>quite absurd for her to carry it further.</p> <p></p> <p> So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to</p> <p>see it trot away quietly into the wood. `If it had grown up,'</p> <p>she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:</p> <p>but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.' And she began</p> <p>thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as</p> <p>pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right</p> <p>way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing</p> <p>the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-</p> <p>natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great</p> <p>many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.</p> <p></p> <p> `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at</p> <p>all know whether it would like the name: however, it only</p> <p>grinned a little wider. `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought</p> <p>Alice, and she went on. `Would you tell me, please, which way I</p> <p>ought to go from here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said</p> <p>the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't much care where--' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk</p> <p>long enough.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another</p> <p>question. `What sort of people live about here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,</p> <p>`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,</p> <p>`lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they're both mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat: `we're all mad here.</p> <p>I'm mad. You're mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on</p> <p>`And how do you know that you're mad?'</p> <p></p> <p> `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad. You grant</p> <p>that?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I suppose so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's</p> <p>angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased. Now I growl when I'm</p> <p>pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call it what you like,' said the Cat. `Do you play croquet</p> <p>with the Queen to-day?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been</p> <p>invited yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used</p> <p>to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place</p> <p>where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.</p> <p></p> <p> `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat. `I'd</p> <p>nearly forgotten to ask.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had</p> <p>come back in a natural way.</p> <p></p> <p> `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it</p> <p>did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the</p> <p>direction in which the March Hare was said to live. `I've seen</p> <p>hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be</p> <p>much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be</p> <p>raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.' As she said</p> <p>this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a</p> <p>branch of a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.</p> <p></p> <p> `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep</p> <p>appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'</p> <p></p> <p> `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,</p> <p>beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,</p> <p>which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever</p> <p>saw in my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the</p> <p>house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house,</p> <p>because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was</p> <p>thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not</p> <p>like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand</p> <p>bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even</p> <p>then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself</p> <p>`Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost wish I'd</p> <p>gone to see the Hatter instead!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VII</p> <p></p> <p> A Mad Tea-Party</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,</p> <p>and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a</p> <p>Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two</p> <p>were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking</p> <p>over its head. `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;</p> <p>`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'</p> <p></p> <p> The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded</p> <p>together at one corner of it: `No room! No room!' they cried</p> <p>out when they saw Alice coming. `There's PLENTY of room!' said</p> <p>Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one</p> <p>end of the table.</p> <p></p> <p> `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it</p> <p>but tea. `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice</p> <p>angrily.</p> <p></p> <p> `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being</p> <p>invited,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a</p> <p>great many more than three.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter. He had been</p> <p>looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was</p> <p>his first speech.</p> <p></p> <p> `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said</p> <p>with some severity; `it's very rude.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all</p> <p>he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice. `I'm glad</p> <p>they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she</p> <p>added aloud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'</p> <p>said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what</p> <p>I say--that's the same thing, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter. `You might just</p> <p>as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat</p> <p>what I see"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I</p> <p>like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to</p> <p>be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the</p> <p>same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the</p> <p>conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,</p> <p>while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and</p> <p>writing-desks, which wasn't much.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter was the first to break the silence. `What day of</p> <p>the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his</p> <p>watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking</p> <p>it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter. `I told you butter</p> <p>wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March</p> <p>Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter</p> <p>grumbled: `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'</p> <p></p> <p> The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then</p> <p>he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he</p> <p>could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It</p> <p>was the BEST butter, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.</p> <p>`What a funny watch!' she remarked. `It tells the day of the</p> <p>month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter. `Does YOUR watch tell</p> <p>you what year it is?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily: `but that's</p> <p>because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to</p> <p>have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.</p> <p>`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she</p> <p>could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured</p> <p>a little hot tea upon its nose.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without</p> <p>opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to</p> <p>remark myself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to</p> <p>Alice again.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I give it up,' Alice replied: `what's the answer?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nor I,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice sighed wearily. `I think you might do something better</p> <p>with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that</p> <p>have no answers.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you</p> <p>wouldn't talk about wasting IT. It's HIM.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head</p> <p>contemptuously. `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied: `but I know I have to</p> <p>beat time when I learn music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter. `He won't stand</p> <p>beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do</p> <p>almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose</p> <p>it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:</p> <p>you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the</p> <p>clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!'</p> <p></p> <p> (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a</p> <p>whisper.)</p> <p></p> <p> `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:</p> <p>`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter: `but you could keep</p> <p>it to half-past one as long as you liked.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter shook his head mournfully. `Not I!' he replied.</p> <p>`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'</p> <p>(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the</p> <p>great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing</p> <p></p> <p> "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!</p> <p> How I wonder what you're at!"</p> <p></p> <p>You know the song, perhaps?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--</p> <p></p> <p> "Up above the world you fly,</p> <p> Like a tea-tray in the sky.</p> <p> Twinkle, twinkle--"'</p> <p></p> <p>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep</p> <p>`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that</p> <p>they had to pinch it to make it stop.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,</p> <p>`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the</p> <p>time! Off with his head!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,</p> <p>`he won't do a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.'</p> <p></p> <p> A bright idea came into Alice's head. `Is that the reason so</p> <p>many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: `it's always</p> <p>tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Exactly so,' said the Hatter: `as the things get used up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice</p> <p>ventured to ask.</p> <p></p> <p> `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,</p> <p>yawning. `I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady</p> <p>tells us a story.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at</p> <p>the proposal.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried. `Wake up,</p> <p>Dormouse!' And they pinched it on both sides at once.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. `I wasn't asleep,' he</p> <p>said in a hoarse, feeble voice: `I heard every word you fellows</p> <p>were saying.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep</p> <p>again before it's done.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the</p> <p>Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,</p> <p>Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great</p> <p>interest in questions of eating and drinking.</p> <p></p> <p> `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a</p> <p>minute or two.</p> <p></p> <p> `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently</p> <p>remarked; `they'd have been ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways</p> <p>of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went</p> <p>on: `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very</p> <p>earnestly.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so</p> <p>I can't take more.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter: `it's very</p> <p>easy to take MORE than nothing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked</p> <p>triumphantly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped</p> <p>herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the</p> <p>Dormouse, and repeated her question. `Why did they live at the</p> <p>bottom of a well?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and</p> <p>then said, `It was a treacle-well.'</p> <p></p> <p> `There's no such thing!' Alice was beginning very angrily, but</p> <p>the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse</p> <p>sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the</p> <p>story for yourself.'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt</p> <p>again. I dare say there may be ONE.'</p> <p></p> <p> `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he</p> <p>consented to go on. `And so these three little sisters--they</p> <p>were learning to draw, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this</p> <p>time.</p> <p></p> <p> `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter: `let's all move</p> <p>one place on.'</p> <p></p> <p> He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the</p> <p>March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather</p> <p>unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the</p> <p>only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a</p> <p>good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset</p> <p>the milk-jug into his plate.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began</p> <p>very cautiously: `But I don't understand. Where did they draw</p> <p>the treacle from?'</p> <p></p> <p> `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so</p> <p>I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,</p> <p>stupid?'</p> <p></p> <p> `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not</p> <p>choosing to notice this last remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'</p> <p></p> <p> This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse</p> <p>go on for some time without interrupting it.</p> <p></p> <p> `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and</p> <p>rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew</p> <p>all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why with an M?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why not?' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going</p> <p>off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up</p> <p>again with a little shriek, and went on: `--that begins with an</p> <p>M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--</p> <p>you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever</p> <p>see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I</p> <p>don't think--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got</p> <p>up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep</p> <p>instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her</p> <p>going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that</p> <p>they would call after her: the last time she saw them, they were</p> <p>trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.</p> <p></p> <p> `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she</p> <p>picked her way through the wood. `It's the stupidest tea-party I</p> <p>ever was at in all my life!'</p> <p></p> <p> Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a</p> <p>door leading right into it. `That's very curious!' she thought.</p> <p>`But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.'</p> <p>And in she went.</p> <p></p> <p> Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the</p> <p>little glass table. `Now, I'll manage better this time,'</p> <p>she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,</p> <p>and unlocking the door that led into the garden. Then she went</p> <p>to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it</p> <p>in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then she walked down</p> <p>the little passage: and THEN--she found herself at last in the</p> <p>beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER VIII</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's Croquet-Ground</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the</p> <p>roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at</p> <p>it, busily painting them red. Alice thought this a very curious</p> <p>thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up</p> <p>to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! Don't go</p> <p>splashing paint over me like that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged</p> <p>my elbow.'</p> <p></p> <p> On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five! Always</p> <p>lay the blame on others!'</p> <p></p> <p> `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five. `I heard the Queen say only</p> <p>yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it</p> <p>was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'</p> <p></p> <p> Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all</p> <p>the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as</p> <p>she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the</p> <p>others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are</p> <p>painting those roses?'</p> <p></p> <p> Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a</p> <p>low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to</p> <p>have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;</p> <p>and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads</p> <p>cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore</p> <p>she comes, to--' At this moment Five, who had been anxiously</p> <p>looking across the garden, called out `The Queen! The Queen!'</p> <p>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon</p> <p>their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice</p> <p>looked round, eager to see the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped</p> <p>like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and</p> <p>feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were</p> <p>ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the</p> <p>soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were</p> <p>ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand</p> <p>in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next</p> <p>came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice</p> <p>recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous</p> <p>manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without</p> <p>noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the</p> <p>King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this</p> <p>grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on</p> <p>her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember</p> <p>ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,</p> <p>what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people</p> <p>had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'</p> <p>So she stood still where she was, and waited.</p> <p></p> <p> When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped</p> <p>and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'</p> <p>She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,</p> <p>turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'</p> <p></p> <p> `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very</p> <p>politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of</p> <p>cards, after all. I needn't be afraid of them!'</p> <p></p> <p> `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three</p> <p>gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as</p> <p>they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs</p> <p>was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether</p> <p>they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her</p> <p>own children.</p> <p></p> <p> `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.</p> <p>`It's no business of MINE.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her</p> <p>for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!</p> <p>Off--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the</p> <p>Queen was silent.</p> <p></p> <p> The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said</p> <p>`Consider, my dear: she is only a child!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave</p> <p>`Turn them over!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.</p> <p></p> <p> `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the</p> <p>three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the</p> <p>King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.</p> <p></p> <p> `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen. `You make me giddy.'</p> <p>And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you</p> <p>been doing here?'</p> <p></p> <p> `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,</p> <p>going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the</p> <p>roses. `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,</p> <p>three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate</p> <p>gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.</p> <p></p> <p> `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a</p> <p>large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered</p> <p>about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly</p> <p>marched off after the others.</p> <p></p> <p> `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers</p> <p>shouted in reply.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's right!' shouted the Queen. `Can you play croquet?'</p> <p></p> <p> The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question</p> <p>was evidently meant for her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes!' shouted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the</p> <p>procession, wondering very much what would happen next.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.</p> <p>She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously</p> <p>into her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very,' said Alice: `--where's the Duchess?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hush! Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He</p> <p>looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised</p> <p>himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and</p> <p>whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What for?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, I didn't,' said Alice: `I don't think it's at all a pity.</p> <p>I said "What for?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began. Alice gave a</p> <p>little scream of laughter. `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a</p> <p>frightened tone. `The Queen will hear you! You see, she came</p> <p>rather late, and the Queen said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,</p> <p>and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up</p> <p>against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or</p> <p>two, and the game began. Alice thought she had never seen such a</p> <p>curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and</p> <p>furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live</p> <p>flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to</p> <p>stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.</p> <p></p> <p> The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her</p> <p>flamingo: she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,</p> <p>comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,</p> <p>but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened</p> <p>out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it</p> <p>WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a</p> <p>puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:</p> <p>and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,</p> <p>it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled</p> <p>itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this,</p> <p>there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she</p> <p>wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers</p> <p>were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the</p> <p>ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very</p> <p>difficult game indeed.</p> <p></p> <p> The players all played at once without waiting for turns,</p> <p>quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in</p> <p>a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went</p> <p>stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with</p> <p>her head!' about once in a minute.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as</p> <p>yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might</p> <p>happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of</p> <p>me? They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great</p> <p>wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'</p> <p></p> <p> She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering</p> <p>whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a</p> <p>curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at</p> <p>first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to</p> <p>be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat: now I</p> <p>shall have somebody to talk to.'</p> <p></p> <p> `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was</p> <p>mouth enough for it to speak with.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. `It's no</p> <p>use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at</p> <p>least one of them.' In another minute the whole head appeared,</p> <p>and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the</p> <p>game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her. The</p> <p>Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and</p> <p>no more of it appeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather</p> <p>a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't</p> <p>hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in</p> <p>particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and</p> <p>you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;</p> <p>for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next</p> <p>walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have</p> <p>croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it</p> <p>saw mine coming!'</p> <p></p> <p> `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not at all,' said Alice: `she's so extremely--' Just then</p> <p>she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so</p> <p>she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while</p> <p>finishing the game.'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen smiled and passed on.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and</p> <p>looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice: `allow me</p> <p>to introduce it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:</p> <p>`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me</p> <p>like that!' He got behind Alice as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice. `I've read that in</p> <p>some book, but I don't remember where.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and</p> <p>he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear! I</p> <p>wish you would have this cat removed!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great</p> <p>or small. `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking</p> <p>round.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and</p> <p>he hurried off.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game</p> <p>was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,</p> <p>screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three</p> <p>of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and</p> <p>she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in</p> <p>such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or</p> <p>not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.</p> <p></p> <p> The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,</p> <p>which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one</p> <p>of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her</p> <p>flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where</p> <p>Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up</p> <p>into a tree.</p> <p></p> <p> By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,</p> <p>the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:</p> <p>`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches</p> <p>are gone from this side of the ground.' So she tucked it away</p> <p>under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for</p> <p>a little more conversation with her friend.</p> <p></p> <p> When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to</p> <p>find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute</p> <p>going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who</p> <p>were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,</p> <p>and looked very uncomfortable.</p> <p></p> <p> The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to</p> <p>settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,</p> <p>though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed</p> <p>to make out exactly what they said.</p> <p></p> <p> The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a</p> <p>head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had</p> <p>never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin</p> <p>at HIS time of life.</p> <p></p> <p> The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be</p> <p>beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.</p> <p></p> <p> The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about</p> <p>it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.</p> <p>(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so</p> <p>grave and anxious.)</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the</p> <p>Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner: `fetch</p> <p>her here.' And the executioner went off like an arrow.</p> <p></p> <p> The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,</p> <p>by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely</p> <p>disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down</p> <p>looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER IX</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle's Story</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old</p> <p>thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately</p> <p>into Alice's, and they walked off together.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and</p> <p>thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had</p> <p>made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.</p> <p></p> <p> `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very</p> <p>hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT</p> <p>ALL. Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that</p> <p>makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at</p> <p>having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them</p> <p>sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar</p> <p>and such things that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish</p> <p>people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you</p> <p>know--'</p> <p></p> <p> She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a</p> <p>little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.</p> <p>`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you</p> <p>forget to talk. I can't tell you just now what the moral of that</p> <p>is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.</p> <p></p> <p> `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess. `Everything's got a</p> <p>moral, if only you can find it.' And she squeezed herself up</p> <p>closer to Alice's side as she spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first,</p> <p>because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was</p> <p>exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,</p> <p>and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not</p> <p>like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.</p> <p></p> <p> `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of</p> <p>keeping up the conversation a little.</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis so,' said the Duchess: `and the moral of that is--"Oh,</p> <p>'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody</p> <p>minding their own business!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah, well! It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,</p> <p>digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,</p> <p>`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the</p> <p>sounds will take care of themselves."'</p> <p></p> <p> `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to</p> <p>herself.</p> <p></p> <p> `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your</p> <p>waist,' the Duchess said after a pause: `the reason is, that I'm</p> <p>doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the</p> <p>experiment?'</p> <p></p> <p> `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all</p> <p>anxious to have the experiment tried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very true,' said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both</p> <p>bite. And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock</p> <p>together."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess: `what a clear way you</p> <p>have of putting things!'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree</p> <p>to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near</p> <p>here. And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the</p> <p>less there is of yours."'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this</p> <p>last remark, `it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it</p> <p>is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of</p> <p>that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put</p> <p>more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than</p> <p>what it might appear to others that what you were or might have</p> <p>been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared</p> <p>to them to be otherwise."'</p> <p></p> <p> `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very</p> <p>politely, `if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it</p> <p>as you say it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess</p> <p>replied, in a pleased tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'</p> <p>said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess. `I make you</p> <p>a present of everything I've said as yet.'</p> <p></p> <p> `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice. `I'm glad they don't</p> <p>give birthday presents like that!' But she did not venture to</p> <p>say it out loud.</p> <p></p> <p> `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her</p> <p>sharp little chin.</p> <p></p> <p> `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was</p> <p>beginning to feel a little worried.</p> <p></p> <p> `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;</p> <p>and the m--'</p> <p></p> <p> But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died</p> <p>away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the</p> <p>arm that was linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up,</p> <p>and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,</p> <p>frowning like a thunderstorm.</p> <p></p> <p> `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on</p> <p>the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,</p> <p>and that in about half no time! Take your choice!'</p> <p></p> <p> The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.</p> <p></p> <p> `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice</p> <p>was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her</p> <p>back to the croquet-ground.</p> <p></p> <p> The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,</p> <p>and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her,</p> <p>they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a</p> <p>moment's delay would cost them their lives.</p> <p></p> <p> All the time they were playing the Queen never left off</p> <p>quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his</p> <p>head!' or `Off with her head!' Those whom she sentenced were</p> <p>taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave</p> <p>off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour</p> <p>or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the</p> <p>King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of</p> <p>execution.</p> <p></p> <p> Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to</p> <p>Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'</p> <p></p> <p> `No,' said Alice. `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his</p> <p>history,'</p> <p></p> <p> As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low</p> <p>voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.' `Come,</p> <p>THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite</p> <p>unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.</p> <p></p> <p> They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the</p> <p>sun. (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)</p> <p>`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to</p> <p>see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and</p> <p>see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,</p> <p>leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like</p> <p>the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would</p> <p>be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage</p> <p>Queen: so she waited.</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the</p> <p>Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. `What fun!'</p> <p>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the fun?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon. `It's all her fancy, that: they</p> <p>never executes nobody, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went</p> <p>slowly after it: `I never was so ordered about in all my life,</p> <p>never!'</p> <p></p> <p> They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the</p> <p>distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,</p> <p>as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart</p> <p>would break. She pitied him deeply. `What is his sorrow?' she</p> <p>asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the</p> <p>same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that: he hasn't got</p> <p>no sorrow, you know. Come on!'</p> <p></p> <p> So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with</p> <p>large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to</p> <p>know your history, she do.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow</p> <p>tone: `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've</p> <p>finished.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice</p> <p>thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he</p> <p>doesn't begin.' But she waited patiently.</p> <p></p> <p> `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was</p> <p>a real Turtle.'</p> <p></p> <p> These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only</p> <p>by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and</p> <p>the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very</p> <p>nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your</p> <p>interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be</p> <p>more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.</p> <p></p> <p> `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more</p> <p>calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to</p> <p>school in the sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call</p> <p>him Tortoise--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle angrily: `really you are very dull!'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple</p> <p>question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and</p> <p>looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At</p> <p>last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!</p> <p>Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe</p> <p>it--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak</p> <p>again. The Mock Turtle went on.</p> <p></p> <p> `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school</p> <p>every day--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be</p> <p>so proud as all that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock</p> <p>Turtle in a tone of great relief. `Now at OURS they had at the</p> <p>end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'</p> <p></p> <p> `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the</p> <p>bottom of the sea.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a</p> <p>sigh. `I only took the regular course.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was that?' inquired Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock</p> <p>Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--</p> <p>Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say. `What is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. `What! Never</p> <p>heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed. `You know what to beautify is,</p> <p>I suppose?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully: `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to</p> <p>uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about</p> <p>it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you</p> <p>to learn?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting</p> <p>off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,</p> <p>with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old</p> <p>conger-eel, that used to come once a week: HE taught us</p> <p>Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What was THAT like?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said: `I'm</p> <p>too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon: `I went to the Classics</p> <p>master, though. He was an old crab, HE was.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: `he</p> <p>taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'</p> <p></p> <p> `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;</p> <p>and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a</p> <p>hurry to change the subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the</p> <p>next, and so on.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon</p> <p>remarked: `because they lessen from day to day.'</p> <p></p> <p> This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a</p> <p>little before she made her next remark. `Then the eleventh day</p> <p>must have been a holiday?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a</p> <p>very decided tone: `tell her something about the games now.'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER X</p> <p></p> <p> The Lobster Quadrille</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper</p> <p>across his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for</p> <p>a minute or two sobs choked his voice. `Same as if he had a bone</p> <p>in his throat,' said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him</p> <p>and punching him in the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered</p> <p>his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on</p> <p>again:--</p> <p></p> <p> `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--</p> <p>`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'</p> <p>(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,</p> <p>and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful</p> <p>thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'</p> <p></p> <p> `No, indeed,' said Alice. `What sort of a dance is it?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle. `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;</p> <p>then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'</p> <p></p> <p> `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `--you advance twice--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said: `advance twice, set to</p> <p>partners--'</p> <p></p> <p> `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the</p> <p>Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.</p> <p></p> <p> `--as far out to sea as you can--'</p> <p></p> <p> `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,</p> <p>capering wildly about.</p> <p></p> <p> `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the</p> <p>Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,</p> <p>who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat</p> <p>down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.</p> <p></p> <p> `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `Very much indeed,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the</p> <p>Gryphon. `We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall</p> <p>sing?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon. `I've forgotten the words.'</p> <p></p> <p> So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now</p> <p>and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and</p> <p>waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle</p> <p>sang this, very slowly and sadly:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>`"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.</p> <p>"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my</p> <p> tail.</p> <p>See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!</p> <p>They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p>Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p>dance?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be</p> <p>When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to</p> <p> sea!"</p> <p>But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look</p> <p> askance--</p> <p>Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the</p> <p> dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p> Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join</p> <p> the dance.</p> <p></p> <p>`"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.</p> <p>"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.</p> <p>The further off from England the nearer is to France--</p> <p>Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.</p> <p></p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the</p> <p> dance?</p> <p> Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the</p> <p> dance?"'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said</p> <p>Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: `and I do so</p> <p>like that curious song about the whiting!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've</p> <p>seen them, of course?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she</p> <p>checked herself hastily.</p> <p></p> <p> `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but</p> <p>if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're</p> <p>like.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully. `They have their</p> <p>tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:</p> <p>`crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails</p> <p>in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle</p> <p>yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all</p> <p>that,' he said to the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with</p> <p>the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So</p> <p>they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in</p> <p>their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again. That's all.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting. I never knew</p> <p>so much about a whiting before.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the</p> <p>Gryphon. `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'</p> <p></p> <p> `I never thought about it,' said Alice. `Why?'</p> <p></p> <p> `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very</p> <p>solemnly.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice was thoroughly puzzled. `Does the boots and shoes!' she</p> <p>repeated in a wondering tone.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon. `I</p> <p>mean, what makes them so shiny?'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she</p> <p>gave her answer. `They're done with blacking, I believe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep</p> <p>voice, `are done with a whiting. Now you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great</p> <p>curiosity.</p> <p></p> <p> `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather</p> <p>impatiently: `any shrimp could have told you that.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were</p> <p>still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep</p> <p>back, please: we don't want YOU with us!"'</p> <p></p> <p> `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>said: `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came</p> <p>to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With</p> <p>what porpoise?"'</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended</p> <p>tone. And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR</p> <p>adventures.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'</p> <p>said Alice a little timidly: `but it's no use going back to</p> <p>yesterday, because I was a different person then.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no! The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an</p> <p>impatient tone: `explanations take such a dreadful time.'</p> <p></p> <p> So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when</p> <p>she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about</p> <p>it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on</p> <p>each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she</p> <p>gained courage as she went on. Her listeners were perfectly</p> <p>quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,</p> <p>FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming</p> <p>different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said</p> <p>`That's very curious.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated</p> <p>thoughtfully. `I should like to hear her try and repeat</p> <p>something now. Tell her to begin.' He looked at the Gryphon as</p> <p>if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said</p> <p>the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat</p> <p>lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'</p> <p>However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so</p> <p>full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was</p> <p>saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--</p> <p></p> <p> `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,</p> <p> "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."</p> <p> As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose</p> <p> Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,</p> <p> And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,</p> <p> But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,</p> <p> His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]</p> <p></p> <p> `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'</p> <p>said the Gryphon.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it</p> <p>sounds uncommon nonsense.'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her</p> <p>hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way</p> <p>again.</p> <p></p> <p> `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily. `Go on with</p> <p>the next verse.'</p> <p></p> <p> `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted. `How COULD</p> <p>he turn them out with his nose, you know?'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was</p> <p>dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the</p> <p>subject.</p> <p></p> <p> `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:</p> <p>`it begins "I passed by his garden."'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would</p> <p>all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--</p> <p></p> <p> `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,</p> <p> How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'</p> <p></p> <p> [later editions continued as follows</p> <p> The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,</p> <p> While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.</p> <p> When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,</p> <p> Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:</p> <p> While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,</p> <p> And concluded the banquet--]</p> <p></p> <p> `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle</p> <p>interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far</p> <p>the most confusing thing I ever heard!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon: and</p> <p>Alice was only too glad to do so.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the</p> <p>Gryphon went on. `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you</p> <p>a song?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'</p> <p>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather</p> <p>offended tone, `Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her</p> <p>"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes</p> <p>choked with sobs, to sing this:--</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,</p> <p> Waiting in a hot tureen!</p> <p> Who for such dainties would not stoop?</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!</p> <p></p> <p> `Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,</p> <p> Game, or any other dish?</p> <p> Who would not give all else for two</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!</p> <p> Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had</p> <p>just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'</p> <p>was heard in the distance.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,</p> <p>it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.</p> <p></p> <p> `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon</p> <p>only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more</p> <p>faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the</p> <p>melancholy words:--</p> <p></p> <p> `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,</p> <p> Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XI</p> <p></p> <p> Who Stole the Tarts?</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when</p> <p>they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts</p> <p>of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:</p> <p>the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on</p> <p>each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,</p> <p>with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the</p> <p>other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large</p> <p>dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice</p> <p>quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'</p> <p>she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!' But there seemed</p> <p>to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about</p> <p>her, to pass away the time.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had</p> <p>read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that</p> <p>she knew the name of nearly everything there. `That's the</p> <p>judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'</p> <p></p> <p> The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown</p> <p>over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he</p> <p>did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly</p> <p>not becoming.</p> <p></p> <p> `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve</p> <p>creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because</p> <p>some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they</p> <p>are the jurors.' She said this last word two or three times over</p> <p>to herself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and</p> <p>rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the</p> <p>meaning of it at all. However, `jury-men' would have done just</p> <p>as well.</p> <p></p> <p> The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.</p> <p>`What are they doing?' Alice whispered to the Gryphon. `They</p> <p>can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'</p> <p></p> <p> `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in</p> <p>reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the</p> <p>trial.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but</p> <p>she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in</p> <p>the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked</p> <p>anxiously round, to make out who was talking.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their</p> <p>shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'</p> <p>on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them</p> <p>didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his</p> <p>neighbour to tell him. `A nice muddle their slates'll be in</p> <p>before the trial's over!' thought Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course,</p> <p>Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got</p> <p>behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it</p> <p>away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was</p> <p>Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of</p> <p>it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write</p> <p>with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very</p> <p>little use, as it left no mark on the slate.</p> <p></p> <p> `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and</p> <p>then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--</p> <p></p> <p> `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,</p> <p> All on a summer day:</p> <p> The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,</p> <p> And took them quite away!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.</p> <p></p> <p> `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. `There's</p> <p>a great deal to come before that!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit</p> <p>blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First</p> <p>witness!'</p> <p></p> <p> The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in</p> <p>one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. `I beg</p> <p>pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in: but I</p> <p>hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You ought to have finished,' said the King. `When did you</p> <p>begin?'</p> <p></p> <p> The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into</p> <p>the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. `Fourteenth of March, I</p> <p>think it was,' he said.</p> <p></p> <p> `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury</p> <p>eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then</p> <p>added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.</p> <p></p> <p> `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who</p> <p>instantly made a memorandum of the fact.</p> <p></p> <p> `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;</p> <p>`I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'</p> <p></p> <p> Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or</p> <p>I'll have you executed on the spot.'</p> <p></p> <p> This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept</p> <p>shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the</p> <p>Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his</p> <p>teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.</p> <p></p> <p> Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which</p> <p>puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was</p> <p>beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she</p> <p>would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she</p> <p>decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for</p> <p>her.</p> <p></p> <p> `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was</p> <p>sitting next to her. `I can hardly breathe.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly: `I'm growing.'</p> <p></p> <p> `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.</p> <p></p> <p> `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly: `you know</p> <p>you're growing too.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:</p> <p>`not in that ridiculous fashion.' And he got up very sulkily</p> <p>and crossed over to the other side of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the</p> <p>Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to</p> <p>one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the</p> <p>singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter</p> <p>trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have</p> <p>you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a</p> <p>trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week</p> <p>or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and</p> <p>the twinkling of the tea--'</p> <p></p> <p> `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.</p> <p></p> <p> `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.</p> <p>`Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things</p> <p>twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'</p> <p></p> <p> `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.</p> <p></p> <p> `You did!' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `I deny it!' said the March Hare.</p> <p></p> <p> `He denies it,' said the King: `leave out that part.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,</p> <p>looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the</p> <p>Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.</p> <p></p> <p> `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-</p> <p>and-butter--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.</p> <p></p> <p> `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you</p> <p>executed.'</p> <p></p> <p> The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,</p> <p>and went down on one knee. `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he</p> <p>began.</p> <p></p> <p> `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately</p> <p>suppressed by the officers of the court. (As that is rather a</p> <p>hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. They had</p> <p>a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:</p> <p>into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat</p> <p>upon it.)</p> <p></p> <p> `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice. `I've so often</p> <p>read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some</p> <p>attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the</p> <p>officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant</p> <p>till now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'</p> <p>continued the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter: `I'm on the floor, as</p> <p>it is.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.</p> <p></p> <p> Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.</p> <p></p> <p> `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice. `Now we</p> <p>shall get on better.'</p> <p></p> <p> `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious</p> <p>look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.</p> <p></p> <p> `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the</p> <p>court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.</p> <p></p> <p> `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one</p> <p>of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the</p> <p>officer could get to the door.</p> <p></p> <p> `Call the next witness!' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The next witness was the Duchess's cook. She carried the</p> <p>pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before</p> <p>she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began</p> <p>sneezing all at once.</p> <p></p> <p> `Give your evidence,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Shan't,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a</p> <p>low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy</p> <p>air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till</p> <p>his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What</p> <p>are tarts made of?'</p> <p></p> <p> `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.</p> <p></p> <p> `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.</p> <p></p> <p> `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out. `Behead that</p> <p>Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch</p> <p>him! Off with his whiskers!'</p> <p></p> <p> For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the</p> <p>Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down</p> <p>again, the cook had disappeared.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.</p> <p>`Call the next witness.' And he added in an undertone to the</p> <p>Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.</p> <p>It quite makes my forehead ache!'</p> <p></p> <p> Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,</p> <p>feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,</p> <p>`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.</p> <p>Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top</p> <p>of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> CHAPTER XII</p> <p></p> <p> Alice's Evidence</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p> `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the</p> <p>moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she</p> <p>jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with</p> <p>the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads</p> <p>of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding</p> <p>her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset</p> <p>the week before.</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great</p> <p>dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,</p> <p>for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and</p> <p>she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once</p> <p>and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.</p> <p></p> <p> `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave</p> <p>voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--</p> <p>ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as</p> <p>he said do.</p> <p></p> <p> Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she</p> <p>had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing</p> <p>was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable</p> <p>to move. She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that</p> <p>it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it</p> <p>would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'</p> <p></p> <p> As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of</p> <p>being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and</p> <p>handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write</p> <p>out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed</p> <p>too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,</p> <p>gazing up into the roof of the court.</p> <p></p> <p> `What do you know about this business?' the King said to</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.</p> <p>They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when</p> <p>the White Rabbit interrupted: `UNimportant, your Majesty means,</p> <p>of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and</p> <p>making faces at him as he spoke.</p> <p></p> <p> `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and</p> <p>went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--</p> <p>unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word</p> <p>sounded best.</p> <p></p> <p> Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some</p> <p>`unimportant.' Alice could see this, as she was near enough to</p> <p>look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she</p> <p>thought to herself.</p> <p></p> <p> At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily</p> <p>writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out</p> <p>from his book, `Rule Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE</p> <p>HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'</p> <p></p> <p> Everybody looked at Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `You are,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice: `besides,</p> <p>that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.</p> <p>`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling</p> <p>voice.</p> <p></p> <p> `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said</p> <p>the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has</p> <p>just been picked up.'</p> <p></p> <p> `What's in it?' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems</p> <p>to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'</p> <p></p> <p> `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was</p> <p>written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,</p> <p>there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.' He unfolded the paper</p> <p>as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set</p> <p>of verses.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of</p> <p>the jurymen.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the</p> <p>queerest thing about it.' (The jury all looked puzzled.)</p> <p></p> <p> `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.</p> <p>(The jury all brightened up again.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and</p> <p>they can't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.'</p> <p></p> <p> `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the</p> <p>matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd</p> <p>have signed your name like an honest man.'</p> <p></p> <p> There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the</p> <p>first really clever thing the King had said that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice. `Why, you don't</p> <p>even know what they're about!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Read them,' said the King.</p> <p></p> <p> The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. `Where shall I begin,</p> <p>please your Majesty?' he asked.</p> <p></p> <p> `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on</p> <p>till you come to the end: then stop.'</p> <p></p> <p> These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--</p> <p></p> <p> `They told me you had been to her,</p> <p> And mentioned me to him:</p> <p> She gave me a good character,</p> <p> But said I could not swim.</p> <p></p> <p> He sent them word I had not gone</p> <p> (We know it to be true):</p> <p> If she should push the matter on,</p> <p> What would become of you?</p> <p></p> <p> I gave her one, they gave him two,</p> <p> You gave us three or more;</p> <p> They all returned from him to you,</p> <p> Though they were mine before.</p> <p></p> <p> If I or she should chance to be</p> <p> Involved in this affair,</p> <p> He trusts to you to set them free,</p> <p> Exactly as we were.</p> <p></p> <p> My notion was that you had been</p> <p> (Before she had this fit)</p> <p> An obstacle that came between</p> <p> Him, and ourselves, and it.</p> <p></p> <p> Don't let him know she liked them best,</p> <p> For this must ever be</p> <p> A secret, kept from all the rest,</p> <p> Between yourself and me.'</p> <p></p> <p> `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'</p> <p>said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'</p> <p></p> <p> `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had</p> <p>grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit</p> <p>afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't</p> <p>believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'</p> <p></p> <p> The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe</p> <p>there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to</p> <p>explain the paper.</p> <p></p> <p> `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a</p> <p>world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And</p> <p>yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his</p> <p>knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some</p> <p>meaning in them, after all. "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you</p> <p>can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.</p> <p></p> <p> The Knave shook his head sadly. `Do I look like it?' he said.</p> <p>(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)</p> <p></p> <p> `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering</p> <p>over the verses to himself: `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's</p> <p>the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,</p> <p>that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'</p> <p></p> <p> `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said</p> <p>Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to</p> <p>the tarts on the table. `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.</p> <p>Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--" you never had fits, my</p> <p>dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.</p> <p></p> <p> `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the</p> <p>Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off</p> <p>writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no</p> <p>mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was</p> <p>trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p> <p></p> <p> `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round</p> <p>the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p> <p></p> <p> `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and</p> <p>everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the</p> <p>King said, for about the twentieth time that day.</p> <p></p> <p> `No, no!' said the Queen. `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'</p> <p></p> <p> `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly. `The idea of having</p> <p>the sentence first!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.</p> <p></p> <p> `I won't!' said Alice.</p> <p></p> <p> `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.</p> <p>Nobody moved.</p> <p></p> <p> `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full</p> <p>size by this time.) `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'</p> <p></p> <p> At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying</p> <p>down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half</p> <p>of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on</p> <p>the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently</p> <p>brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the</p> <p>trees upon her face.</p> <p></p> <p> `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long</p> <p>sleep you've had!'</p> <p></p> <p> `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told</p> <p>her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange</p> <p>Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and</p> <p>when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a</p> <p>curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's</p> <p>getting late.' So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she</p> <p>ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.</p> <p></p> <p> But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her</p> <p>head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of</p> <p>little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began</p> <p>dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--</p> <p></p> <p> First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the</p> <p>tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes</p> <p>were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her</p> <p>voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back</p> <p>the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and</p> <p>still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place</p> <p>around her became alive the strange creatures of her little</p> <p>sister's dream.</p> <p></p> <p> The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried</p> <p>by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the</p> <p>neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as</p> <p>the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,</p> <p>and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate</p> <p>guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the</p> <p>Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once</p> <p>more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's</p> <p>slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,</p> <p>filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable</p> <p>Mock Turtle.</p> <p></p> <p> So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in</p> <p>Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and</p> <p>all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only</p> <p>rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the</p> <p>reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-</p> <p>bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd</p> <p>boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and</p> <p>all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the</p> <p>confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the</p> <p>cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's</p> <p>heavy sobs.</p> <p></p> <p> Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of</p> <p>hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how</p> <p>she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and</p> <p>loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about</p> <p>her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager</p> <p>with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of</p> <p>Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their</p> <p>simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,</p> <p>remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.</p> <p></p> <p> THE END</p>
